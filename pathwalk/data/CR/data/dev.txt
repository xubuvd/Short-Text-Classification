1	it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones
0	in fact , i 'd have to rate it among the worst i 've ever encountered
1	the picture quality surprised me , when i first saw this camera i saw how small it was an instantly assumed that the picture quality would not be good but i was wrong !
1	everything that i have listed above , the zen has , and more
0	once it froze so bad i couldn 't even use the power button to turn it off , and had to open and take out the battery
0	the only problem is the battery life
1	while the ease of use was very impressive , i was put off by the price about 130 more than what i paid amazon for this player
0	protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window
0	even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little , resulting in a noisy start up
1	the champ works great
1	im able to keep my phone on for about a week ( mostly stand by ) to three days ( regular use )
1	it 's oval and nice
0	apex has still not responded to my email describing the problem after almost a week and their customer service line is always busy
0	in short nokia themselves don 't know that this phone doesn 't work with the palm , and if you don 't heed my advice you will spend hours with technicians around the globe reading from scripts , chiding you in broken english for not following their directions exactly
0	it ain 't cutting edge ( no pun intended ) state of the art with all the latest bells whistles it definitely ain 't pretty
1	the zen plays mp3 , wma and wave formats , which makes it more versatile than the ipod
1	this is by far the nicest one , in so many ways
1	interface practically seamless
0	the construction of the player is the cheesiest i have ever seen the front panel refused to clip in correctly , leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the player
1	this is the best phone i have seen
0	3 mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws
1	the extra gb of hard rive space , remove able battery and fm tuner , as well as the fact that i was previously a satisfied owner of the nomad ii put it over the top for me
1	amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping
1	it definitely keeps the smell out
0	the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the battery , seemed to come undone very easily
1	i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality
1	but anyway , the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing
0	however , the creative software is not real intuitive
0	verdict had i not needed something with a tad bit more space , i consider this player fair game
1	versatile and stylish
0	is it necessary to scan my ms money database when i close the program ?
1	you can even use the ipod to store files from your pc and export your outlook files to it
0	this program would not let me send outlook email or listen to audible sample books online
1	mine installed no problem ( but i did uninstall my norton anti virus 2002 personal firewall 2002 first )
1	overall it is a great value
1	these tasks are faster and easier than in prior versions , and i found the menu to be much more navigable
1	i have less money invested in the router table and dual routers than i would have if i had purchased a single cheap reliant sharper
0	the price is more
1	it fits in your pocket
1	i use it on a router table , and it is works well
1	i could take 1 2 passes and it still didn 't skip a beat
1	the dual antenna is a plus and the design is slick
1	i was looking for a compact , rugged ( i carry it hiking , skiing , boating , etc ) camera which is easy to use
1	the controls are easy to understand and big enough that they are easy to see and use
1	the log functions helps you track down the incoming , outgoing calls in the most easy of ways
0	the quick sync is n 't any good because it either needs to be configured properly or just is n 't very useful
0	when taking pictures of people , however , it shows every flaw in the subject 's skin
1	the pics can be touched up in photoshop , and be printed at 4x6 and they look great !
1	i 've had no problems with the software
1	i must have gotten a good one
0	however , it is much bigger , bulkier , and heavier than my other router and i would not like to use it freehand ( i keep it mounted in a table )
1	the software included is an easy installation and you have the option of using the creative software , windows media player 10 , or simply windows explorer to move music back and forth between your zen touch
1	the plusses are the features , look , good signal and battery life , memory size and robustness
0	however , the battery life isn 't as good as i would like
1	what a kick butt mp3 machine and the freedom to get songs from a reasonable source , instead of paying for them two or three times , then get the creative zen ipod killer , kiss my ass itunes !
1	2 battery life is over 4 5 hours , compared to about 2 5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikon 's
0	the software is somewhat nice to look at , using it is not the easiest
1	i have had no problem either with backward compatibility , in that the mixed mode feature lets you both 54 and 11 mb cards off the router
0	when i purchase software , i never want to have to spend hours looking up solutions to my install problems in particular solutions that involve manually setting driver preferences or editing the registry !
1	so , why the small digital elph , rather than one of the other cameras with better resolution or picture quality ? size 2
1	they could be more comfortable , but no complaints in the sound department
0	it would just spin up and stop , and display no disc
1	even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under 1200
0	the eq is awful , and even at top volumes , the bass is flat sounding
1	this is a well made and powerful tool
0	my main complaints are that it should be deeper or wider as it doesn 't even fit a smaller sized garbage bag
0	this router was a huge disappointment
1	this product is a lifesaver ! !
0	the case is strong and stylish , but unfortunately lacks a window ( now a big deal )
0	sometimes , it needs few minutes to open an application
0	many other reviewers are mentioning that they have had no problems at all i would say that the main problem is that this player is just not made very well
1	well , it was nice while it lasted
0	i was some what sceptically when i seen the price deference between the other makers of comparable hp
0	the 6600 will provide similar service in more developed areas of the states and not as well in more remote areas
0	the included headphones suck , so get your own
0	apple still does it better but needs to come out with a 5 gig mini
1	on the whole , i 'm quite happy with the purchase
1	a huge beautiful color screen which can not been scratched at all even with the rough handling i give it
1	incredible memory !
0	this simple nuance was too much for nokia , and they still refuse to acknowledge the fact that their technician could have broken the phone or repair the phone for free
1	also if you want a device that does so much more than the ipod mini but is at the same price , this is the player for you
0	i have trashed this product on other opinion sites based on this major flaw alone
1	the image quality is excellent
0	also , for some reason the picture looks washed out on s video , with lots of color bleeding , compared to a component connection ( should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27 tv )
1	the music plays awesome , never skips , even if u run for a bit , so you can listen to music without interruption
0	we got two phones for the t mobile family plan ( indeed very easy to switch to the family plan ) and one came with a broken headphone ( can hear but can not be heard ) and one died today after less than two weeks of use
1	you have the option to have the flash automatic or off
0	one complaint the screen is too easily scratched !
1	i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers
0	the zen xtra will transfer the files to the player , but not the folder name
1	the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad
1	dependability i 've seen no glitches
1	its not a perfect system but its a very good one
1	a very well made product that has worked very well for me over the years
1	lastly , the price is fantastic
0	the unit itself did lock up a few times and i had to hit the reset button but that was a fairly painless process as well
0	another thing you should know , the metal on the flip side of the ipod is very tacky , and scratches very easily
1	i found that to be the most impressive thing about the ipod 'mini ' basically for ease of use , and the feel it gives
0	unfortunately , linksys does not write the best documentation
1	simple to use and hook up
1	i wanted this product because i didn 't have to buy special bags for it and it also came highly recommended
1	the ipod package comes with everything you need , the ac adaptor , firewire cable ( quicker than usb , but slower than usb 2 which it also gives ) , those snazzy and power full headphones , and of course the player
1	great value 40gb vs 10 gb ipod for the price
1	all in all , this is a wonderful device
0	for example , in auto mode you can 't use the flash redeye reduction , you must be in manual mode for that
1	the camera and video functionality is decent , i can 't see myself wasting my time with it , but some people will
0	every time nomad thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes
1	update i knew that i loved the champ , and using the diaper genie at a friend 's house really reinforced that !
0	shortly after i brought it , the plunging shafts started sticking
1	bottom line is that at 160 , this is an absolute steal
0	the only thing i would complain about the zen xtra is that the controls are n 't as easy as the ipod 's , or as sexy looking
1	its really cool
1	you need to know absolutely nothing about setting up the network
1	after comparing the included creative earbuds directly against my sony md e828lp 's and sennheiser mx 400 's , i find myself still using the creative 's , which in my opinion , sound every bit as good and have a slightly longer cord
0	no voice activated dialing ( what were they thinking
1	very fast powerup and great speed when taking multiple pictures
1	the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an auto mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use
1	perhaps semantic could work out the efficiency a little , but these reviews are highly exaggerated i would ask what else these people are running on their computers ( ? )
1	the sound is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on your sound quality , the sound might crack
0	the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop off face , that sometimes comes off a bit easily , but besides that it 's perfect
1	with nikon , although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches
0	you even can not navigate by genre artist album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre , no other division
1	i have had mine for about a year and use a third party firmware on mine and love it
1	however , for a 600 800 budget , i think this camera is an excellent choice
1	you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of now playing interface , you can see the interface as modern or classical
1	picture quality 's great for still and video with sound
1	i use a nokia 6600 , it has a great color tft display and camera equipped with zoom , which complement a built in video recorder with audio and a real one player for playback and streaming of 3gpp compatible and real media video clips
1	it works great
0	secondly , in addition to the lag each time you give a command , it 's just not that easily use able on the go
1	all the features are incredibly intuitive , even for a novice like me
1	i use this with a home theater system and it 's amazing how it sounds , the picture clarity is unmatched !
1	nis 2003 worked like a charm last year
1	simple click buttons , back buttons volume and display are very easy to read , access and use
1	it works great , i am usually at the full 54 mbps , although every now and then that drops to around 36 mbps only because i am 2 floors below where the router is
1	another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs , though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i 'd scanned before buying
1	this thing does everything but washes your dishes
0	i thought it was kind of steeply priced at that time
0	one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all
1	i checked out the amazon reviews and i 'm pleased to say mine worked , works , fine right out of the box
1	gets nice sound too
0	i have never had this problem with any other software on my computer
0	although i find it more convenient to use 1 touch dialing , this phone does not have voice dialing
1	the eax settings are somewhat superfluous but not really a negative
0	my old siemens s56 , on the other hand , worked beautifully with all of the above
0	first , it failed whenever connecting to get updates
1	battery recharge , is an awesome thing , because it recharges in only like 2 3 hours
0	and the case , how did this ever make it out of quality control
0	the player kept displaying no disc , so i tried the disc in another machine and sure as !
0	the only problem is the size of the keys
1	high quality video and pictures rock !
1	i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options shutter priority , aperture priority , light metering adjustments , etc , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear
1	with one of the most intuitive user interfaces around , seamless bluetooth sync with microsoft outlook , support for thousands of applications for the symbian platform which this phone runs on ( i own the ir remote , iq and a few others ) , the nokia 6600 is all of the above one of the few phones from t mobile that can claim such a distinction
1	with canon , you get pictures that appear to be photos , not still camcorder shots
0	i thought it was just the player , but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media
0	i 've had this player for several months and it reads most discs , but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players ( from friends season 2 )
0	only one disk played through to completion successfully
1	a decent piece of hardware with great speed ( i get the same speeds as with my comp connected directly to the modem ) and good signal quality
1	as i drove across the country i lost reception only in eastern kentucky 's mountains
0	my son tried it and he too couldn 't change the speed without an assist
0	the entire unit was poorly crafted
0	t mobile wasn 't upfront about some of the terms to qualify for the rebate
0	it worked from 12 26 to 1 9 at which time the picture failed completely ( see other negative reviews my unit was n 't the only one this happened to )
1	5 the camera installed on this phone is awesome
1	easy to use , small form factor , and looks good to boot
0	it was impossible to change the speed with just my fingers
0	the volume key can be hard to press , but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw , perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call
0	this is not an enterprise piece of hardware that you will find in an office or corporate environment
0	one still works fine , the other quit after one day
0	the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just plain does n 't load on some computers
0	what really made this a mediocre mp3 player for me was the software
1	the pictures are uniformly excellent and color rendering is perfect
1	i can tell using the phone that it feels a little flimsier than motorola 's do , but as long as i 'm not planning on dropping the phone or running over it with my car it should be just fine
1	good quality video
1	i really liked the price
0	the auto focus on the camera seems to have trouble focusing on the subject
1	i 've only had this camera for a few days , but it 's been great
1	this camera is great if you 're used to a high end slr
0	the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap is uncomfortable to use
1	one good thing , it is 40 gb of disk space ( well , it is 38 gb in reality )
1	the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4 times optical zooms gets you just that much closer
1	update ( march 2005 ) my son has been out of diapers for almost 2 years now , but the diaper champ hung in there till the very end easy to use , no problems with odors , and one of the best bargains among all of the paraphernalia required for the modern baby )
1	but , i would definately recommend this phone
0	f ) it doesnt look pretty spending this kind of cash , you want something that has the aesthetics bit down , of course
0	then when i went to norton 's website to obtain a priority id number per the instructions i had been given , i couldn 't find a way to get one
0	mine was 2 weeks old and i chucked it in the trash , where it belongs
1	i have an ipod and it is a great buy
0	it barely holds anything and mine just puts a bunch of thread fuzzes all over the player , because the bag is cheap and seems to be coming apart
1	the sound quality is excellent , except , maybe a tad too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line
0	there technical service isn 't helpful either they just read what 's on their website and charge you 50 ( toll fees ) to do it
1	i do like this phone overall ( would give it a 3 5 ) , but unfortunately , i am returning it
0	it was n 't as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman
0	the grain was terrible
1	this camera is an excellent choice for an ultracompact , take anywhere device and boasts an outstanding movie mode to boot
1	silverfish color really adds a special touch
1	i use the scented bags and even if i don 't no smell !
0	but , the creative zen micro is plagued by a serious , serious stupid and elemenatary design flaw , and i 'm going to tell you what it is but first , two more things about this piece of garbage that 's so great and could 've made it a potential ipod killer
0	there are some highs to the 2004 edition , but mostly lows
0	whatever on to the negatives touchy about charging you can damage the battery and seriously decrease it 's life if you don 't upgrade the firmware or dont ' heed the advice to always plug in the player side of the cord before plugging in the outlet side
0	i thought given all the 10 reviews about this camera that i would buy it in spite of being a bit pricey
1	service is great as far as i can tell , features work like a charm , ringtones are high quality if you buy them from t mobile and aim is great
1	i use the router with a 3 1 2in raised panel bit with no problems
0	not compatible with audible com books
1	navigating through the menus is super easy , especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone
1	no down time , great signal strength
1	i haven 't tried to set up any advanced features on the router , but it is not difficult to set up for basic use
1	the installation , set up , and operating interfaces are well organized and intuitive and the email spam component works well
1	nokia makes great phones , and this one is the cream of the crop
1	overall , this router seems like a reasonably priced product th !
1	when the overall image quality ( especially natural colours , details , natural looking of the pictures ) is the most important thing , then this camera its top notch and very impressive
0	recently the variable speed control went out
1	i love the bluetooth easy to use with a wireless abra headset
1	in true nokia style , the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance , this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned
0	sometimes the pictures are on the dark side , but i 'm able to fix that using the photoshop 6 0 adjust levels function not sure how a person would do that without photoshop , though
1	3 bags are easy to change
1	this router works at 54mbps that 's megabyte not kilobyte
0	the other thing i do n 't like about this 2600 is that it makes the color look over saturated
1	the pictures are beautiful , and the camera is so small you can carry it anywhere
1	much cheaper than i pod good looking player ( beautiful blue back lit screen ) if you 've read about the player , some have complained about the lack of a viewing hole for the face when the case is on , but this is good because the face does n 't get damaged scratched fast transfer rate
0	also the battery life isn 't great but it 's sufficient for my needs
1	whether you are using disposable or cloth diapers , this is the truly the only diaper pail to get !
0	the ad 1600 did n 't work correctly from the start and the ad 1220 lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up
1	even viewed cds full of jogs
1	really easy to use
0	i do here a constant high pitched distorted sound , not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough
0	after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven sent
1	the in ital setup of the router was simple
1	it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use , if you read the manual
0	it is hot enough to be annoying
1	it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general to moderate snapping
1	sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweaking with settings to try to make it great
0	this thing is trash
1	i was looking for something that wasn 't too complicated to use and to help the pics i post on ebay show more detail
1	surfing the web on it is nice as well , i just wish there were more wap pages available
1	the camera does a great job with exposure and prints made with my professional printer looks great ( not as good as prints from my pro digital camera , but still very good )
0	4 the zen stores data files , but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk ( they must be copied to another hard drive to be launched )
1	all the cool features of the mini , but with 20gb instead of 5
1	4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera , 3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon 's quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worth wile at the price
0	they are not wow able good
1	the voice quality is very good , and it gets great reception ( that is , in places where you get t mobile coverage , which is not that good see below )
0	i have sent my ad2600 back to apex because it wo n 't play certain disney and other dvd movies ( no disc message )
0	there was occasionally a lip sync issue ( the lips were n 't moving in time to the dialog )
1	the phone itself is pretty nice
1	file transfers are fast , nearly a song per second via usb 2 0
0	though nearly a dozen different people at both t mobile and nokia have told me otherwise , it is simply not possible to use this phone as a bluetooth modem for the vast majority of pdas and many other devices
1	other mp3 players won 't give you the sonic clarity of the zen at this compression level , so i imagine they won 't at lower ones , either
0	player has a problem with dual layer dvd 's such as alias season 1 and season 2
1	another reason i got it is because you can put wma files on it
0	the little jog dial seems weak and quirky and i hope i do n 't figure out a way to break it
1	it plays everything , even vcd 's
1	further , the tech specs suggest that it has better audio quality than the ipod
1	i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase
0	seemed like a good deal , but this pps frequently can not recognize dvds and music cds takes a long time loading and then concludes , no disc
1	ive seen em all , the archos , dell , ipods , everything good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion
1	the radio and voice recording are nice
1	from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity , to the downloadable poly graphic meg atones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone
1	i recently had to run a 3 4 straight bit through hard maple to make a deep dado and was amazed that this machine didn 't even slow down
0	the only other problem with this router that i have encountered is the plunge action will start to stick , then it needs to be cleaned and lubricated
1	the player does seem to play dvds adequately enough
0	navigation is a bit tricky and takes getting used to but the included pdf instructions cover the operation pretty well
0	the pictures are a little dark sometimes
1	i brought it for my sister in college and she loves it !
0	now in october , 2004 , the firewall said i couldn 't ok anymore software to use the internet because its full
0	8mb for a camera like this is a joke
1	it feels solid and not flimsy like the carbon
0	3 it is slow , if you keep the original configuration and prigs ( why 'd u buy it then ? ! ) it 'll run smoothly , but still slower than most other coloured screen nokias
0	i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused
0	2 ) scroll button switch
1	i discovered that the camera has a manual mode that gives you total control over exposure , white balance , flash ( red eye , person against bright background , flash on , flash off , flash automatic )
1	great reception , visibility and interface ( may be complicated by others )
0	the battery life can 't be very long let 's not be greedy
1	( he had owned two apex dvd players , and was pleased with both of them )
1	i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to maneuver through the menus quickly
0	2 despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality , i experienced a flaw using eax
0	also , the lens cap design is flawed
1	it 's cute as anything and the glowing blue led looks super cool around the edges
0	if you have no previous version of nortron security on your system , or nortron antivirus , the installation will go fine , otherwise dig in and in to do a major registery clean up ! the old programs will leave a trace that will mess up the new installation , even if you uninstalled the old programs perfectly
0	the buttons are rather stiff
0	about 10 of the time it can 't find the device when i attach it to my pc
0	stay away from this product !
1	creative media source is very easy to use once you get the hang of it , and the file transfers are fast
0	a couple of times a week it seems to cease access to the internet
1	without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i 've seen
1	i am very pleased with the apex ad2600 it plays just about anything you put in the drawer
0	sometimes a suite is not a good deal and all you get is a bundle of headaches
0	another problem i had with this camera was the zoom function
0	its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does n 't since with contact lists , phone numbers , address books , etc like the ipod ( which eliminated my need for any kind of palm device )
0	1 ) quite bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectors s 1 aps slr ) and uses a heavy battery , although not very solid as it is contracted mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line )
0	you 'll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best
1	the display is awesome , you can see everything you want and read it clearly
0	does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones , or external receivers ( car radio )
0	not a killer problem , but not well done , either
1	in the hands of someone who does n 't , it will yield good results on idiot program auto mode
0	so yes , as with all software bundled with creative products , it was useless and ugly
1	huge storage space even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of songs on this thing
1	ripping your songs and creating playlists could n 't be any easier
1	the first thing i did was upgrade the firmware to the version required for wmp10 , it syncs flawlessly with media player and transfers are fast
1	replaceable battery
1	the best part about this router is now i have a dhaka server
1	when the router is working it is a very nice machine for the money
0	it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got
0	some more manual control would have been nice
1	bottom line great product , unbeatable price
1	this is a great product , and canon has done an excellent job
1	the phone is small , light , and very attractive
1	this is quite simply the best you can ask for
1	it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep
1	i own this phone for about 6 months now , i have used the following features bluetooth connection to laptop and desktop for sync contacts and calendars with outlook , transfer files ( movies , songs ) , i have many movies on it now with a 512mb memory card that it takes
1	i bought the player this week and i like it by far
1	other than that , i think it is the best router for the money
1	the screen is clear and readable , and the touch pad works very well , it took me less than a day to get the hang of it , and now i like it better than having to click buttons or fiddle with a separate volume control
0	no proprietary headset jack
1	the big backlight makes things easy to see , and the writing is big enough for people to see
0	the electronic speed control is not doing it 's job and the router begins to speed up and slow down at will
1	i take a lot of pictures and this camera is my first choice
1	it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily
1	usb 2 0 transfer is insanely fast
0	although the sd500 takes great quality photos , the sensitivity of the lcd compromises the quality overall
1	transfers are surprisingly quick through usb 2 0
0	the software sucks
0	this was obviously a conspiracy as it is freak in ' easy to manufacture a device with replaceable batteries ! !
1	i am very pleased with its quality and durability
0	one bad thing though , i find the remote control a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably ' die ' before the player does
1	the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides
1	so the pretty solid router all around good for the money here 's the link to firmware updates http www suavest com forum6 html
1	clear the call logs once in a while to speed up the phone people ! ! !
1	ball metaphor i was hoping creative hit a home run here , and i think the zen micro is more like a stand up double
1	the lcd screen was very large and readable
0	such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in wrong !
1	the software with the ipod includes itunes , which allows you to play the music on your computer , rip cds onto your computer , and move your music from the computer to the ipod
0	it still smelled
1	! ok , score 7 0 oh yes , the newest color of this phone is quite cool
1	this did n 't bother me too much because it 's still a decent size
1	the picture quality of this camera is outstanding ( taking its ' size and price into consideration )
1	if you want a sharp looking , fast digital camera and you don 't need or want manual controls , then this is the camera for you !
1	if you want to work wirelessly , this router does just what you want it to do and my geek friends say that the security is as good as it gets right now
0	my other nit is that it didn 't include at least some kind of carrying case for everything
1	i downloaded and updated the firmware , and followed the easy setup instructions
1	they say that they are the best pictures they have ever see from a compact
0	3 ) folders can not be created for the audio files
1	i am ripping my cd collection into 160 kbps wma files this gives an average of around 60 65 mb per cd , good for about 900 cds in the 57 , 000 mb of free memory available to me
1	the included leather pouch is a big plus it actually protects the unit well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices
0	even after all the nightmare sound problems , i 'd still half way like this product if it kept it 's promise the ability to store 1500 songs
1	sure , this thing is definitely more cost effective than an ipod
1	so far it has been very durable ( other than the little pads on the earbuds ) , but those aren 't really necessary as i find them comfortable on their own
1	second , the automatic sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer
1	1 it uses regular garbage bags instead of brand refills
1	working for 10 hours with it on shuffle totally rocks ! !
1	built like a tank , yet nimble enough to be comfortably used with the leigh dovetail jig
1	upon opening the box i was confronted with this small cute little mp3 player
0	creative are the sound people for computers , i can 't understand why eax would introduce static
1	the speed control is well designed and it works perfectly
1	having usb 2 0 makes for very fast transfers
0	feedback on creative 's product support is universally poor this is not limited to the zen , it applies to all the company 's products
1	i still have my s70 because i like the wider lens sometimes , but in general , if you are looking for a small camera with the whole package , the sd500 is the only one you should buy
0	the diaper genie needs it 's own refill bags in order to work and that 's just more money that you don 't have to spend
0	another thing i don 't like is that some of the features take 1 2 seconds to load up
0	then it started to smell whether there were diapers in it or not
1	it takes great pictures , operates quickly , and feels solid
1	this camera has canon 's great calorimetry , plus what you see in the lcd is what you get
0	well , my second one is now beginning to hi cup a bit after about 1 1 2 years
1	the player 's software is very easy to use and very good
0	1 ) it is perhaps too small
1	4 the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking
1	the sound is bright and clear , the ability to store any mp3 's ( and not just apple approved files ) is great , and i plan to make use of the storage space and sound recording from time to time
1	i purchased this router at a woodworking show after watching the ct people using it to demo their bits and was impressed how it performed
1	wish i could give it 4 1 2 stars
0	this is somewhat annoying , but from working with computers ( especially windows ugh )
1	very sleek stylish as well as the screen options and visuals it has
1	the battery life on this phone is surreal
0	i 've been bothered by blown out highlights on the s330 , and the g3 seems to do only slightly better
0	software music match jukebox is n 't the greatest , the search function is n 't fast even when accessing it with the hot key shortcut
1	nokia does not disappoint in this model
1	the program is called nomad and works great for me and seems to cover all the features the included windows software does
0	and the remote is cheap and ch easy not sure how long it 'll last , but for 50 bucks what the heck !
1	it looks really sleek and stylish , and does everything it claims
0	software is absolutely terrible
1	games not really important , but exist ant
1	i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode
1	i have been very impressed with my purchase of the sd500 i bought it at the beginning of the month as the ultimate pocket camera and have shot 300 images so far with it
0	have tried calling ( 866 4apexgo ) , but can 't get through
1	it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features
1	i had a casio unit , which had given great service , and would have been happy to get another one , but was tempted by the ipod 's sleek design , storage capacity , connection options firewire and usb , and its integration with itunes
1	i have to say that i am very happy with it so far
0	then the most disappointing was trying to use viper raised panel bits that just barely fit , and i mean just barely
1	this has so many capabilities that you 'll always have room for new technologies as they evolve
1	4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera
1	it is small , unlike my canon slr , so it easily fits in my pocket
0	unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could n 't play all my dvds , and now the player can 't play everything
1	a few of my work constituents owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality
0	long reboots due to norton taking forever to boot
0	the plug er gets stuck you have to manually extract the mess
1	the sound is just fine
1	it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice
1	5 check traffic411 com for la traffic on the 405
0	my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be , at best , a 40gb portable hard drive , albeit one on which i can 't create folders , or , at worst , a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again ( i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating )
0	next , the big reason not to buy any norton product if there 's a problem with it , norton charges 30 to even tell them about it
1	i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does n 't take weeks to figure out how to operate
1	the phone also sports an image gallery ( with option camera attachment ) , a calendar organizer , alarm clock with snooze , fm radio ( way cool , even if it is just through an ear peice ) , games , java applications and gprs high speed internet connection
0	the scroll button is overly sensitive at times not sensitive enough at others
0	it also has unproven battery life
1	however , there is a more detailed pdf manual on the cd ( and online ) that should answer any questions about the operational features of the zen micro
1	but , for the money it is a good machine
1	its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently , lying on bed 38 phone lying by your pillow side
1	there is no odor and extremely easy to use
1	the free ( i didnt know they still did that ) carrying case is really protective , and to me its the only accessory you need ( except good headphones )
0	the fact that the 0 key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing , as many phones use the key instead
0	personally , i may never buy symantect products again
1	the box is upstairs , and in the farthest room i get connected at 11 18m speed that is similar to the older 10m ethernet standard
1	the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay 300 for this great player
1	i 've used the corporate edition at work without any problems ever
0	the zoom goes up and down in magnification , which is nice , but there is always a display of the zoom size about one quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings
1	the container is hard to open , which is exactly what you want when your baby becomes a toddler , and you do have to flip the handle carefully ( which has saved more than a few of her toys , too ) i don 't consider these difficulties but features for the older baby
0	if it weren 't so big i would probably by another since no shop is complete without a handful of routers
1	i 've used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar
1	and we definitely prefer our champ !
1	i would recommend this camera unequivocally !
1	( you can do it one handed while still hanging on to the baby ) also , we like using regular trash bags instead of having to worry about buying refills ( like with the diaper genie )
1	i have stored 40 audio cds and i still have close to 2 8 gb free
1	for the price and size and features , you can 't beat the price
1	all reviews i 've seen seem to indicate that the creative mp3 jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukebox ed ( ipod , archos , dell , samsung )
1	there were a few attractive features , such as the small size and the layout of the remote
0	but , all of this means nothing , because of the serious , serious , stupid and ridiculously elemenatary design flaw after 3 months , give or take a few weeks , you won 't be able to hear anything
1	there seem to be fewer collisions and dropped packets as i read from the router logs than with my old dlink router
0	the tech support is worthless too
1	you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right
0	it 's important that people know the following first , the interface is slow
1	i could probably use a trash can and be ok at this point , but this pr duct seems to work very well so far
1	this is a good deal for music and data storage
1	the zx boasts superior sound quality than the ipod , however it compromises a bit of the unit 's size in doing so
1	i love the performance and features of this router
0	as a computer , or pda its weak since the screen , while large by phone standards , is still tiny to really do anything on
0	only used for 3 month before it 's down !
1	large easy readable screen
1	they 're easy to use
1	the player looked good right out of the box , offering lots of features and good styling
1	i finally decided to purchase this player because it was compatible with napster 2 go which is a subscription service , allowing me to download as much music as i want for a 14 95 flat fee
1	since then , i have not found one major problem with it
1	i thought the fm radio would not see much use with so many tracks available to me , but its great for tuning in to tv programs at the gym while on the treadmill , concerts and programs being simulcast , npr , and on and on
1	this is a very light phone a little less than 3 oz , with long battery life ( not as long as the new polymer technology )
1	its just as fast as the included creative software , but much less invasive , and overall better looking
0	the fine adjustment knob which came with the router was very difficult to use on a router table
1	using your own bags is much cheaper and convenient
1	i went out and got the canon today
1	and bluetooth does not drain the battery as quick as i thought it would , i usually can go 1 5 days with bluetooth on along with making calls before i need a full recharge
1	i like the size and weight of this little critter
0	output went black and white only via both s video and composite connections , and with no v hold
1	mixed bag i guess but the price was right
1	it 's still alive , still kicking , and still playing
1	this is a must have product for all new moms !
0	the only reason for not giving it 5 stars the claimed battery life of 12 hours is very optimistic possible maybe if you really sit down and listen continuously for 12 hours without ever touching the player , but in real life i can probably get 6 8 hours at most
0	first off , the battery
0	there were sharp screw tips on the underside of the unit coming from inside that were obviously used to anchor the internal control board
1	i have the black one and adore it
0	i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks , when t zones never worked
0	cheap construction they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners
1	overall , i feel that it 's a decent buy , and am happy that i own it
1	first i 'll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good
0	i have used norton for the past 5 years and for the last 2 years , the software has gotten more and more disgraceful
1	12 ) big storage my entire cd collection in one small device ( 5717 songs , 491 albums and counting ) !
0	the battery life of this phone is at most 2 days and at least one day at excessive use
1	apex ad 2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd r rw and dvd r rw ( unlike sony or panasonic one supports only r rw and another supports r rw )
0	i must say , this one is quite slow to open an application
1	the software you get with this camera is perfect
0	3 the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture
0	you have to wonder why creative can 't get this right
0	the remote is flimsy feeling and awkward to use
0	the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho hum software that comes with the system , and the traveling case it comes with
0	only con i can think of is no camera
0	just don 't get drawn into t mobile 's catchy rebate
1	it has one more resolution of 1024x768 and a normal compression mode and , it has the 3x zoom
1	for the hobbiest , it 's probably a nice buy
1	the player is great
1	i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it 's nice to know that there 're there
1	the flash is surprisingly good and even the video quality is excellent
1	this is the best purchase i 've made in a very long time
1	it 's easy to use not too small , and not too big
1	accessing files by artist and album ( i mostly look things up by artist ) is easy and intuitive
1	this one has a good looking
1	it contains the smell from our baby 's diapers and we can use just about any kind of bag inside
1	despite its being slightly larger than the ipod , i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box !
0	buying software that can not be installed normally and being put into the position of having a non working computer
1	bottom line great phone for the time being
0	again , this is a design flaw in the headphone !
1	the picture rs are amazing
1	few month ago , it 's very popular among my community
1	the features are really cool like the radio
0	i spent hours setting up the stations ( accepts about 13 14 , i believe ) , though the reception is unpredictable
1	it is a nice router in all ways but one
1	i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it
0	it is made of plastic
1	loved the slim design
0	mediasource did not recognize my tags !
1	what makes it so great is the versatility and the number of features it has
0	the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch
1	initially these phones were fun to play with some of the cool features like the speaker phone , web browser and of course the built in camera
1	in addition it is very easy to setup
1	it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well
1	we use regular kitchen sized garbage bags
1	if anyone is thinking of getting an ipod mini , forget it and go with this player
1	the player is smaller than you think
1	we really enjoyed shooting with the canon powershot sd500
1	great features
1	i love the diaper champ , it is really easy to use and since you can use regular garbage bags it doesn 't cost an arm and a leg for refills
0	the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots
1	this is a perfect blend to accomplish both tasks
1	3 it never smelled at all
1	it still fits in the palm of your hand , and it 's not heavy
1	despite the things that i have listed so far , i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work , to the gym , in the car , etc
0	the adobe software also was wonderful in 98 but it will not let you print correctly with xp so you are forced to create your document then either print it from windows or export it to another application
1	they look fantastic
1	it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into
1	i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd , but it also was able to play vb files which i created with smart ripper
0	the biggest red flag for me was the fact that although my cousin 's player was relatively new , it was riddled with scratches
0	the only problem is that occasionally the joystick does start to dig into your thumb while gaming
0	for one thing , the diapers always get jammed in it
1	8 connected the phone to my tablet pc and now can access company von at 56k speed via bluetooth
1	as far as dealing with network access of other computers this router is pretty good given the price remember this router is the same one that was released right when the g standard was introduced to the market
0	the only problem i have is with the handle you use to open the top compartment
0	d ) software is another great misfortune hard to operate , crashes frequently , screwed my music library up , doesnt work with mp4s , the list goes on and on
0	unfortunately , after loading 280 songs , all i get now is player either not connected or busy
0	there will be much erasing of text as , one would tend to type something instead of the actual letters
1	i 'm not sure whether this is related to the charge cycle of its li ion battery , the better firmware , or a combination of both factors
1	big lcd screen at least for me , 2 is enough
1	if you love your cell phone games or changing your ring tones everyday , nokia beats everyone else
0	this camera uses a lithium battery , i find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient because what if you are on vacation , where the nearest place to buy batteries is just a gas station there is no way that you are going to find lithium batteries there
0	when talking the voice is not very clear
1	overall i like it
1	i got this for christmas , and it is a great gift
1	the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibels , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods
1	first , the zen lets you sync to more than one computer
0	5 ) lack of good accessories this is more of an oversight of creative 's marketing
0	again , every review written about the tech line is true after waiting close to 45 minutes i finally spoke to a rep
1	this holds alot and does not take up alot of space
1	best electronic i 've bought since i was born
1	go for the champ
0	got a system error problem 30 days after purchase
1	because other people that complain about this player are talking bull , this player is awesome , it just breaks fast , which is horrible
1	it is very simple to import via photo 2 and then move them to photoshop
1	the voice recorder is a beautiful add on not even necessary , but just an example of why apple just wants your money and creative labs wants to make a better player
1	i never get dropped calls
1	it 's easy to use ( just a flip of the lid , and the diaper is gone ! )
0	it 's oftentimes hard to get a good grip on the router , activate the chuck lock , and get enough muscle behind the wrench to get the collet loosened up
0	the plunge action isn 't smooth unless you make it so
1	so far the dvd works so i hope it does n 't break down like the reviews i 've read
0	apple 's ipod battery replacement service costs 100 !
0	the zoom function on this camera is so loud that sometimes you will be unable to use it if you find yourself in a situation where you must be quiet
0	the only knock i have is that the flash is underpowered
0	this process can be very annoying and unsafe when you are driving a stick shift on the highway
0	this phone doesn 't include phone card calling
0	it wo n 't play all of my movies
1	i love this camera
0	depressing the scroll button ( for selecting ) is not always responsive
1	it seems to be working fine , but we 've not used it all that much
1	when i opened the box , i was shocked by the size of this thing it 's tiny !
1	considering the price and specs , this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player
1	definitely a great camera
1	the included eax support is useful at times , especially when you listen to a variety of genres , as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle
0	kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward , but i can deal with that
1	in my opinion it 's the best camera for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images
1	i don 't have problems with the depth adjustment , the speed control , the collet ( i haven 't tried the 1 4 sleeve yet )
1	i like the speed control
1	perhaps i bought the micro to be different , the cheaper price tag ( from amazon ) , the design , or avoiding the high ipod theft in nyc subways
0	these people takes lest effort to process rebate forms
1	it has everything i needed bluetooth , infrared , support for mmc , camera , and a good operating system with lots of supporting software
1	i find that it is stable in my hands and its ' weight actually contributes to that stability
0	the interface used could be better designed
