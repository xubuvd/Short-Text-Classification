1	with accessories , you can make the ipod into a digital recorder , broadcast it remotely through stereo speakers using wireless technology , and play it through your car speakers using either a cd adaptor or fm stereo broadcaster
0	but if i installed either one of these norton products , neither works after installation ?
1	it 's such a great camera ! i think it really was worth the investment )
1	the size is tiny , which i love
0	it would not hang up on calls
1	1 speakers at home , i rarely use it with the earbuds , though they are much better than the ones you normally get with other mp3 players
1	but the sound is very good ( and loud ) and works well on my portable speakers
0	the scroll bar is a bit of a pain
0	3 no voice recorder this has also become an important and popular feature that the ipod unfortunately doesn 't have
1	i think that for its price compared to the ipod the creative zen is pretty good
1	6 small but very clear tft screen
1	i have had several mp3 players over the past few years , and have to say that this by far is the best that i 've owned
1	although the supplied software can be annoying at times , on whole it is excellent
0	this unit was working fine for the 1st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared
1	i found using the supplied mediasource software very easy
1	this phone is very user friendly , easy to manipulate 38 very convenient to scroll in menu etc
0	it 's not as stylized as a sony or samsung
1	it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price
0	the instructions that come with it do n 't explain how to make things simple
1	ive had this phone for a year now and its the best phone i have owned
0	i read many reviews on norton i s 2004 from a variety of sources ( cnet , amazon , message boards ) and came to the conclusion that nis 04 was a terrible product and not worth the update
0	apex sucks !
1	it makes the nomad i purchase feel and look like junk
1	but it is smooth , it is powerful , it is affordable it has a proven track record
0	the way you have to shove your fingers under it and pull is just too tight
1	plus , if you order from amazon com , they will exchange it for you no problem
1	great camera , i have been using this for several months and got excellent results , simple friendly usage , in many scenes indoor , outdoor , snow , close up macro etc
1	i 'd be happy to talk to anyone about this camera
1	that 's a rare and valuable feature
1	the menu allows you to search for files by artist , genre , and album quite easily
1	this phone won me over , and a big seller was the size it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out
1	but it takes gorgeous pictures for a 2 1 mp camera
1	this one is full of features ( has bluetooth )
1	otherwise , it takes very good pictures shutter delay is n 't so bad either
1	i 've dropped it at least a dozen times to my recollection and it still works as good as ever
0	my last simpler nokia started right up and was immediately ready for use
1	i am quite happy having over 10 gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder
1	it looks very cool , and seems quite small to me and very light
0	weak points touch pad design could be better volume control controlled through the vertical strip , but purchasing a headphone with built in volume control will do the trick
0	my one issue with the mediasource software is that , despite pulling id3 tag data from the dds service , the ripping process fails to populate the year field
0	navigation system the zen xtra uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs
1	i would recommend this product to anyone
0	i get to chapter 34 and everything freezes !
0	i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds
1	the sd500 software install was seamless and the product documentation is very detailed
0	while transferring songs to the player , the interface has crashed a few times ( 4 5 times in a 4 5 hour period ) normally this would cause me major concern , but it appears that this bug is reproducible , which leads me to believe that creative will fix it with a patched version shortly ( or maybe it 's just my computer )
1	i really dislike holding a phone to my ear , and i 've found the free speak to be very comfortable and easy to use with this phone
1	this is a great phone i have this phone since feb 04 and i never have any problem at all
1	five gigabytes is plenty for my great albums
0	having spent considerable time with professional video gear , i find onscreen displays annoying
1	i have really enjoyed the camera on this phone
1	this is my first digital camera , and what a ' toy ' it is !
1	the ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic ?
1	the phone 's sound quality is great ( turn up the volume if its too quiet , people , this thing will get loud ) i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing
1	there is no comparison , the champ is easy and smell free , the genie was difficult to use one handed ( which is absolutly vital if you have a little one on a changing pad ) and there was a def finite odor emanating from the genie plus we found that the quick tie garbage bags where the ties are integrated into the bag work really well because there isn 't any added bulk around the sealing edge of the champ
1	ok , not quite everything but this camera is so compact that you will have it by your side when you need it
1	i found best results in most situation with manual center auto focus , manual mode , iso 100 ( shorter aperture time , so more often sharper images as with iso 50 ) , auto white balance ( auto white balance is better than of the other canon cameras i have and they already do very well )
0	one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low
0	after 3 months , it stopped playing higher number scenes on dvds
1	awesome for the newbie , though i personally like to fasten every bolt myself
1	no need for deodorizers
1	it will read and play all cd audio disc
0	however , symantec has taken a significant turn for the worse with this release
1	this camera is great , wonderfully small , and has attractive hi tech casing
0	it does not have an auto focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light
1	feature wise , its a lot better than the dlink and netgear routers out there
0	i tried disabling the various components provided with this product , paring it all the way back to anti virus only service and saw no improvement
0	unit took forever since the beginning to recognize and play discs
1	they also sound excellent compared to other earbuds including retail sets like panasonic 's and sennheisers
1	this linksys router does it for the right price
0	downside is the size of the phone , it is big for today 's standard
1	yes , the features are numerous
0	during install , nis would either freeze or not reboot properly when asked to do so
0	its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket
1	the diaper champ is the best !
1	the radio works excellent in my area , i 'm not sure everywhere else
0	when i finally got it working , it only worked properly for many a month
1	no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers
1	the diaper champ couldn 't be easier to use
1	as far as linksys goes , i have used several of their products and they seem to hold up well no problems
1	with the enormous numbers of diapers that you go through with a newborn , it was great how easy it was to dispose of the dirty ones
1	this is the first cell phone i 've owned , and overall , i am quite pleased with it
0	the only other problem was that security for the wireless connection
1	the games are decent , but u only get 2 to start off with
0	i purchased a jukebox , it got fried while being recharged , they asked for 20usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for reaping the damned thing
1	the focus is great , though , if you are not taking a macro shot
1	i find all of the controls well placed and not flimsy in the least
1	the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use
1	great camera
0	it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long , especially if you use the flash a lot
1	anyhow , this software is working fine and no problems since i installed it two weeks ago
1	extremely convenient
1	3 the nokia 6600 has a brilliant java interface
1	if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder , i highly recommend the camera
1	fm tuner microphone having a tuner in the player is a blessing
1	i 've got a buddy who 's trying to offload his almost new 300 systematic because he saw what this router can do
1	i love how small the thing is , and the blue glow i 've had it for two weeks with no electronic problems at all
1	as i mentioned in my first paragraph , it supports wpa security , which is far superior to wep
1	i 've had a lot of cameras , but this one is actually being used , and not stored in a desk it 's all ways in my shiest pocket
1	but this by far is the best phone out there right now !
1	i 'm amazed at the photo quality prints are indistinguishable from 35mm prints
1	my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money
1	i 've tried playing all of these discs and they all play great
0	who wants to pay 30 to discuss a defect in a product that just cost 95 ? ( i also bought the back up cd )
1	for those mac osx users out there , isync works fairly well
1	it doesn 't stink , ever ( like some have assumed since it doesn 't wrap each diaper into its own neat little cocoon )
0	if you experience problems with installation , you can visit symantec 's website , click the support tab , click the 'home or home office support ' and there is an automated support assistant that can scan the norton program files on your computer and it will tell you what is not working right and how to fix it
1	i also tend to like the sliding cover on switch found on many compact ps cameras since it 's much faster and easier to power on if you need to take that instant shot
1	the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited
1	the scroll wheel is better than the ipod 's as well , in that you do n 't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly just a small nudge of the finger and you 're there
0	and supply those stupid white headphones
0	my old sony ericsson t610 has this feature
0	after i had it a couple weeks , it got into a state where it could never find the device , no matter how often i rebooted my pc , reset the device , reloaded drivers , etc , etc creative 's online support was no help at all
1	and amazon com has it for such a great price how can you go wrong ?
0	was a bit wary because the software is windows only and i have an mac
1	i have over 2000 files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up
1	it is versatile and seems to be one of the best
1	not only is it functional and runs super smooth fast , but it is also eye candy
0	too bad they don 't mention anything about how the cd can 't be used with a mac
0	anyhow some demerits of this phone , the phone has a slow processor and the ear volume is lower than 6610 but then the 6610 has the best ear volume among most nokia variants
1	the cool thing about the ad 2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3 , wma cds , jpeg and kodak picture cds , dvd 's , dvd r 's
1	its easy to use and the sheer fun of being able to use an array of nikon accessories like the telephoto and wide angle lenses is the proverbial icing on the cake
0	other things that i miss are voice activated dialing and a standard 2 5 mm headset jack
0	just the home version of norton internet av has too many glitches and problems to even remotely bother with
1	when it 's working , it 's great but it is very temper mental
1	on the contrary , i 'm quite pleased with my upgrade
0	the number buttons are crammed into a 3x4cm area , the fonts are small , the interface is too convoluted and frustrating , it 's not that customizable as well
1	its ability to record radio is useful as well , but would have been more so if it could be preset
1	2 it can be operated with one hand leaving a hand on your baby on the changing table
0	avoid this product at all costs
1	the phone offers a 32 mb mmc card and i think that is certainly the most exciting feature
0	we constantly got windows virtual memory low error messages popping up foll wed by ridiculous slowdowns and or crashes
1	personally , i am very pleased with the diaper champ
1	i find it very stable and comfortable to use , it doesn 't jump around or make me feel like i need to use a lot of arm strength to keep it under control , and it has very good visibility to see your cut
1	second , it is incredibly easy to use
0	we can start by losing the shiny miracle material cover that you can literally scratch just by looking at it wrong , and thus eliminate the need for third party asking protective covers for an extra thirty bucks
1	i fell in love with this camera , it combines ease of use , with an immense amount of options and power
0	they didn 't know what the problem could be
1	i did n 't read a thing about how to operate it it was just intuitive
1	it is a great phone , if you are traveling all over the world , packed with wonderful features
1	i have been absolutely , completely satisfied with the product and its capabilities
1	1 month , no problems , great phone i 'm very pleased with my 6610 phone
1	i 'm not gonna go into the features cause if you 're reading this review , you 've probably already looked at them , but i must say the dj feature if very cool and the removable battery is also a bonus !
0	t610 supports only midi files
0	the software failed repeatedly
1	have used it frequently and have had no problems
1	you can create playlists , drag drop songs and playlists to your player , and rip directly from cd to your player
0	the included earbuds were uncomfortable
0	the hitachi collet simply was not ground accurately
1	for some this might be a problem , but for the price of a 30 gig ipod , you can get a 60gb nomad , the ipod simply pales in comparison
0	i tried e mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable
0	the photos in the address book are terribly scaled too they look as though they were built out of lego 's
1	i have the software working fine now and the mp3 player is fantastic
1	i connected my camera to the tv and played some video clips and for a digital camera to take such good quality clips , i give it 5 5 stars ) oh and btw , while you take video clips , you can zoom it too ! ( digital zoom only though ) but still ( my old one can 't do that you have to zoom it first if you want then take the video clip )
0	you 're going to need to buy new headphones , the stock ones suck
1	the camera was a marvel
1	overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned
0	only if we could get one camera in it
1	but this does work even if you turn off the lcd viewing great battery saver
0	imagine my shock and absolute instant disdain for any products made by apex
1	i have come across many other beginner cameras that i prefer over this camera , but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size
1	i just bought this player today and i already love it
1	but it you won 't regret it
1	very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera
1	the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds
1	this item is exceptional i like the ease of use and it held the odor in great
1	very easy to use for someone like me who 's just hopping on the digital camera bandwagon
0	iriver has a better fm receiver built in , but the drawback to iriver products is they are flimsy and poorly constructed
0	the instructions would benefit from some improvement and it would help if the rp ms of the speed settings were mentioned
1	the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing
0	knocked 1 star off for the install wizard it wasted alot of time running it
0	now , the player 's ear phone jack is not working i have to send it away again
1	i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits
0	where close to 12 hours but at least it is replaceable ( and they included a second one free )
0	in addition , i don 't believe that it is odorless
1	the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery , just like any other battery powered appliance
0	what i dont like nothing much except headphones , belt clip design
0	if i was pressed to find a negative aspect of the zen micro i would probably have to mention weak fm reception , but the building where i primarily use the micro seems to have a history of terrible radio reception anyway , so you can take that for what it 's worth
0	finally , i gave up and i purchased a router racier
0	being a past norton customer , i consider this to be a slap to my face
1	i actually took a friends word on it and went with this champ when registering and i am glad i did
0	made the camera totally inoperable
1	player works and looks great if you can get the dvd 's to play
0	i am an advanced computer user , so i can not even imagine how a new or novice user would ever get this terrible program to work !
1	however , this ultracompact allows the photographer to personalize his or her shooting preferences through a variety of preset and user definable modes
1	the heavy motor and continuously variable speed control let this router churn through everything i threw at it
1	they are extremely convent and you don 't have to buy them seperately has i tunes , which provides quality music at low prices
1	speakerphone
1	creative has excellent music software , a very responsive tech support group ( they are quick on firmware updates , and make them publicly available ) , and usually a good array of accessories
0	but those 2 come up every time
0	2 you still have to clean the thing ! !
1	there is an open source firmware on the net which has tons of extra features
1	i will never use all the whistles and bells this machine is capable of
1	1 it has all the features an amatuer photo enthusiast would want
1	my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took !
1	the new router came with an updated setup utility that makes getting the router installed a fairly straight forward process
1	however after purchasing a 20 gb ipod it 's clear to see the superiority
0	the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds
1	i didnt get ipod because i dont especially like itunes ( no music i want , but thats just me ) and the creative product was cheaper and i needed to be able to use wma files
1	the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat clean clear and well focused on over 95 of all photos taken by a beginner
1	if you on the other hand always use automatic settings ( and not manual ) you should be just fine , as the camera features some of the best automatic settings i have ever seen
1	the back of the player is nice too , with water ripples inside the clear white coating
0	very bad quality
0	as for the zen micro cons i read that every button is touch sensitive , and thats very annoying when all the main buttons are on the front
0	have had problems since the first day
1	this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio , but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's radio should work perfectly
1	the camera 's a work of art science that 's understood
0	yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway
1	the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality
0	the dynamic range seems not quite as good as the kodak dc260
1	it also has tons more features then previous creative products , and most of them are very useful such as the ability to customize the main menu to show the stuff you want , not the default items ( creative labs com for more on that )
1	first of all , the phone houses a great deal of memory for multiple videos , sound clips , photos , texts , etc
1	on top of being a workhorse and ultra reliable , it is just a plunge router that works really well
1	it has it all
1	the display and brightness on this phone is quite extraordinary
0	and , when you think about it , it 's insulting that norton requires its customers to jump through these hoops anyone who can provide proof of purchase , whether on the phone or online ( what if your computer is down ? ) , should have equal priority
1	it sure does !
1	the radio feature has superb sound quality
0	focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time , pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange
0	if you do n 't have tags , it 'll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they can not be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders
0	the colors are a joke , and i personally hate the stupid vertical touchpad
0	seems the program scan feature did not find the exe file for outlook !
0	after 4 attempted installs , i have finally given up
1	i have no complaints with this mp3 player
0	unfortunately , the touch pad issues non intuitive and poor instruction guide killed it
1	you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy
0	the firmware has bugs too , so download and install the latest firmware from linksys
1	9 ) wake up feature that allows you to set up the player to wake up and play selected music at a specified time
1	the battery life last es 12 hours , and charges quickly ( as mentioned above , the initial charge is a minimum of only two hours not too long at all ! ) once you 've downloaded your music , you can access the tracks by artist , genre , album , composer ( this comes in handy when the actual composer is different from the artist e g covers of songs ) , etc
0	each of the 4 lasted less than six months
0	the vibrate setting is loud !
1	besides the one problem , this machine is amazing !
0	if you are new to the market and looking to buy a symantec software product , save yourself some money and buy the 2003 version
1	what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd rs fill of files ( e , mp3s )
0	the controls are hard to manipulate , especially in the dark
1	for instance , i made several back ups of my dvd movies using dvd r ( w ) and r ( w ) and it plays the dvds
0	otherwise , get a smaller single speed router , which will be much easier to use freehand and is all you need for smaller diameter bits
1	this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities
1	sound exceptional , though i can 't really compare it to the ipod
0	finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best
0	one downside as of this writing , t mobile has n 't updated their t zone system to fully support the 6610
1	this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos , jpeg , wma , cmdr cadre dvd dvd , and of course plays dvd movies from uk i love the giff , progressive scan feature
1	the photo quality is amazing
0	from day one , we 've had hangups , crashes , glitches , continual reboots , long shutdowns due to cc app exe program running which is a norton program
1	the total price with delivery ( free shipping ) was 135 !
1	i must add to the dismay delight of readers this phone is simply the most groundbreaking phone mankind has ever held
1	the unit is easy to use and intuitive
1	it feels tiny in the hand without it
0	my biggest concern is that i have found nokia phones lower quality construction to lead to lower prices , but they also don 't last as long
0	at first i thought it is only a isolated incident , but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my alias dvds as well
1	it 's also easy to empty out
1	they are razor sharp , the color balance is perfect , and the focus is great
1	the voice recorders good , but you can 't record songs off the radio for ring tones
1	hate to wait between shots
1	here 's the brief synopsis the phone is tiny , cute , feels kind of plastic like ( as if it might break ) , but seems pretty sturdy
1	picture and video quality is ok
1	as for bluetooth , no problems at all
0	i 've had nokia 's for years , and while this one is packed with whiz bang features it is disappointing for its primary use a phone
1	and it does an excellent job of keeping the odor contained , which the diaper genie never did !
0	his is what i get for my 200 on this mp3 player ?
1	no skips , and it hasn 't faltered once ( despite your inevitable drop or two
1	11 ) minimal pause between songs less than that on other devices good achievement for a hard drive based player
1	after using it , i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket
1	the powershot g3 is a great camera
0	the face plate , which pops out for the battery , pops open by itself every 10 minutes or so
1	the zen serves as a back up device as well as a player
1	it 's so cute and behind the black panel it glows in a neon blue
1	i must admit its not the best looking phone ever but then it has this look of static and absolute conviction that looks like everything a phone should be
0	as a portable player , it should feel a bit more durable
1	the auto mode is good enough for most shots but the 4300 also boasts 12 versatile scene modes as well as a manual mode though i admit i have n 't played with it too much on manual
1	the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone , which you will enjoy
0	a ) feel cheap the plastic is feels like it would break very easily , and it definately wouldnt survive a drop
0	my only complaint and the reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the on camera controls aren 't as intuitive as they should be
1	this may be a really cool phone , but it 's not worth it with t mobile
1	they are sensitive and accurate ( perhaps too accurate , it senses through t shirt cloth , but the touchpad can be locked ) , but easy to clean , unlike buttons
0	the catch is that , while it plays movies just fine , it has refused to read second discs with the movie extras on them on the two occasions when i tried to do that
0	doesn 't have alot of good games on it
1	you just can 't go wrong with this one !
0	the fm radio 's reception isn 't spectacular , but it will pick up the most powerful stations in any given metro area
0	the opening could be a little wider , i suppose , but i haven 't really seen anything else that could be improved
0	diapers can get stuck when turned around if you don 't tightly wrap them first
0	the machine itself seems fine , but the software that came with it is awful
0	finally you will read a post somewhere that all codes are useless for the apex 2600
1	this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it
1	now he res the stuff you should know starting with the good things the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect , fast as hell in music transfer , controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button , great sound and ive heard many mp3 players , a ton of different equalizer type deals on here
1	removable and cheap battery a li battery usually works properly for 1 3 years
1	supporting an operating system , symbian os , you can download and run a lot of programs on this phone
1	other than that this thing is great
1	it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light
0	the headphone jack gave out after only a couple weeks of use , and the stock earbuds were replaced same day with some high end sony 's i 'd been having
1	i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high end player
0	the cons are n 't really a big deal to me except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files no folder structure and it 's based on the title of the songs many of my songs where separated into folders ( on the pc ) and a few had same titles so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n 't have any that might be the same as another
1	first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better
0	the gprs web access is slow !
0	software the software is crap
0	the scroll wheel is finicky it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have 50 75 success rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the device
1	this product is by far the best broadband router on the market , i bought this to replace one of those linksys instant wireless b routers , worked great for about a year
1	this is a nice feature ( i e it 's early in the morning and you rather listen to easy listening rather than heavy metal no problem
1	it is small overall , bigger than the ipod , but keep in mind that this is because different , less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx
1	for the first few weeks , this player was everything i expected it to be , an affordable multi format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised
1	new firmware update allows for automatic wireless network configuration
0	weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does n 't show the complete file names of mp3s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting ( 2x , 3x , 4x , 1 2x , etc ) before getting back to normal size sorry if i 'm just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly
1	can recommend the hitachi in this ergonomic arena at the price quoted on amazon it is a bargain
1	for the person that uses the equipment every day , pay the extra and get a reliable safer unit
1	it was no problem for me to use their software
1	holds a lot of diapers a full week of toddler diapers !
0	also , when i dial an 800 number like an airline , it will not allow me to use number keys to navigate the prerecorded menu
1	compared to everything else in this category , this is most definately the best bang for the buck
1	i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology
0	4 ) no fm or voice recording these would have been nice extras
1	these issues aside , the ipod is kind of like the cell phone in that once you have one , you can 't be without one
1	possibly the biggest advantage this player has ( if price was n 't enough ) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery
1	the battery is nice
1	7 360 panoramic pictures are a very big deal
1	2 excellent picture quality and so simple to use ! ! !
0	always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped
1	night mode is clear as day
0	after using it for just a month , i could not play any dvd
1	a digic ii powered image processing system enables the sd500 to snap a limitless stream of 7 megapixel photos at a respectable clip , its start up time is tops in its class , and it delivers decent photos when compared to its competition
1	i bought this diaper pail when my son was just a few days old and i absolutely love it !
0	for purposes of clarity , here is my review from that product , edited to be appropriate for this product , since , for the most part , they share many of the same problems
1	i 'm in high school , and this camera is perfect for what i use it for , carrying it around in my pocket so i can take pictures whenever i want to , of my friends and of funny things that happen
1	one primary reason for getting a cell phone was so that i could use it as an internet connection for my laptop running linux , where soft modem drivers are hard to find , and don 't work very well
1	those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use
1	by far this seems to be the best value out there for the money if you are undecided , the creative zen micro seems to be the best choice
0	other than that it is all the same except the new updates
1	this thing plays everything i feed it
0	up , down , left , and right would have given me better control
0	one drop from a pocket or desktop , and it 'd be a goner
0	too costly and not efficient if you ask me !
1	having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific
1	1 ) great sound ( 98db signal to noise ratio beats ipod 's unspecified ratio ) and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head phones as well as external speakers
0	finally , after about a week 's use , the screen started to freeze on me
1	it is light enough to carry around all day without bother
0	( i knew this before hand , and it is not that bad ) there is no tiff format
1	i recommend it to both parents of infants and toddlers
1	it does have a lense cap , but it wo n 't let you take pics with it on which is real good
1	i use the same store brand tall kitchen trash bags i already use in the kitchen for it no special diaper trash bags necessary
1	at any rate , if you have been interested in digital photography but the price and confusion have held you back , consider the canon s100 digital elph
1	good sound plays very nicely , even though the stock headphones are kind of weak durable not the most durable because its mostly plastic , but very compact and sturdy
1	i 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this camera is making me happy
1	i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly
1	i have a canon a 70 , and now this sd500 , its amazing , how this little camera produces , such great pics , it even brings out ur pimples on the face
1	i got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon
0	i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disappointed !
0	after research of other creative hard drive players , i found that most of them aren 't very durable and tend to crash ( read most reviews on amazon com and see for yourself )
1	the leather case it comes with is pretty nice , similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly
1	it took me about an hour to set up a wireless environment in her townhouse and she hasn 't called me yet with any problems
0	the on off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera
1	the metal housing seems very rugged
1	a wise investment for the pocketbook for the nose ! ! !
1	this one has a color display , which i like a lot , being very visual
0	don 't use them , so i delete them for addle space
1	the camera res ponce is very quick
0	the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mils ( real estate broker software ) very well at all
1	get great themes and wallpapers for this phone and many many polyphonic rings
1	after nearly 800 pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures
0	after multiple tries , one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available
0	that is , you can not access the internet at all
1	have had the player since xmas 's and love it !
0	short warranty ( 3 months , so i got the extended warranty at best buy ) , occasional freeze up ( easily fixed by popping out battery ) , somewhat flimsy navigation wheel
1	it 's size also makes it ideal for travel
0	i had some issues when i had enabled wep encryption and then moved on to wpa
0	like other reviewers , installation was hell
0	other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the nomad 's operating system
1	my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price i found both
0	for my first i had a diaper genie which was not only costly with the refills but it was also very stinky
1	with the automatic settings , i really have n 't taken a bad picture yet
1	as any digital camera owner knows is that when you go to take a picture of a moving object to expect some blurring but with some preliminary testing we had simone move there hands back and forth under the lense and another person take the picture and suprisingly a crystal clear image appeared on the decently sized screen
1	i am extremely satisfied with this camera
0	i 've have many nokia 's and while this is the best for features , it 's the worst as a phone
1	i use it primarily in the provided protective case although i have dropped it about 3 feet from my desk ( by accident ) as well as have played it outdoors in 30 fahrenheit weather ( by design ) and it has continued to work fine
0	apex does n 't answer the phone
0	) worst feature possible , this alone makes it rate one star what 's up with no recharge cord ?
1	overall though , i 'm very happy with it and highly recommend it to folks looking for a mp3 player , even if it is to pretend your not a brain dead consumer giving into the marketing hype of the ipod )
1	the quality is superb
0	i find that if you remove the springs it is much easier to adjust and will not stick much
1	i have set up it 's pda features with avaunt com where you can download info from sites like weather , map quest maps directions into it , which is great
0	a little weighty ( 9 ounces no biggie ) , but otherwise fine
0	the movie clips taken will always have some ' noise ' in it you can 't avoid that
0	what is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off
1	i work on word , explorer , netscape , acrobat reader , photoshop at same time ( meaning using a lot of memory ) , but still dont see a problem with computer ( getting slow or crashing )
1	strong points design small , comfortable , curved , and stylish
1	this wonderfully small digital camera produces fantastically good pictures printed on any decent photo quality printer ( with photo quality paper )
1	the interface , while a bit confusing at first , is very easy to navigate after about 15 minutes
1	i still have over 19gb left , and already have over 200 cd 's on it
0	this camera has a major design flaw
1	the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road !
0	also , the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display , so even though the side controls are reachable , i have to open it up to see the display
0	problems with the sound quality were evident right away , but even i couldn 't imagine they 'd be that bad
1	overall , this product is awesome
0	no line out jack as i said , there is none
1	from the internet , woodworking books , local stores and personal opinions the hitachi m12v 3 1 4 hp router time and time again came up to be the router of choice or best for its price
1	i am absolutely in awe of this camera , canon put enormous quality into the g3
0	i hate apex but love amazon , and i tell everyone
1	it 's still one of the smallest 2mp digital cameras on the market , and absolutely one of the best built most stylish cameras ever
0	i purchased this phone knowing it was slightly old as compared to the newer models of nokia phones available
1	i 'm not sure why all the bad reviews , my computer isn 't especially slowed down and i have win '98
1	you do get 1 more gb than an ipod mini
1	overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view
1	if compact size is your highest priority in a 2 megapixel camera , the canon powershot s100 digital elph is a standout choice and aptly named for its diminutive design
1	but this camera is great !
1	its silver magnesium finish is stunning , and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen
1	no vibration !
1	it is a multifunction phone , reception quality is better than the 610
1	now that i have all my music on it there has n 't been any more problems
0	poor visibility on the keys
1	the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect
1	sound quality is amazing i was expecting worse , but its really good ( especially if your files have good sound quality )
1	i would however highly recommend the m12v router !
0	the only downside i have found with this phone is that it is a bit slow to react , meaning when i push the contacts button , it takes a while to load , this is true for almost all the menus and programs on the phone
0	warning ! the windows remove program feature does not do a good job of this , and neither does norton 's own removal program
1	if you are just looking for something to keep with you at all times , then this is a great camera choice
0	i even downloaded the product 's user manual useless
1	i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer
1	if i could , i 'd trade up on my creative muvo2 and snag a zen micro tomorrow
1	slow syncro flash , macro infinity mode , etc
1	other than that , the simian series 60 os is great and offers lots of proprietary software that will work on your phone if you 're willing to hunt for it
1	( it sure does look nice , though ! ) i recommend this to any music lover anywhere the quality of the audio is excellent , the controls and indicators rapidly become intuitive , and the storage capacity and battery life are huge !
1	the design and construction are excellent as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics
1	owner 's manual has substandard troubleshooting guide
0	games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games
1	great phone
1	8 perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets
1	i must have differing preferences than others here , as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony 's that i thought sounded good on other players
1	easy to use a lot of reviews has mentioned about this
0	this time , it started the installation process , then i left for work i think it will work i hope it will work
1	and the biggest plus is that you don 't have to buy any expensive refills
1	this thing is great , i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my counter top and also to listen to my old 8 track records
0	also , the player sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying
0	the battery , as others have said , also seems weaker than creative suggests
1	because of it 's hidden features ( no macro vision , non regional ) i keep this baby around to watch non american region dvd 's
0	the navigation takes so much time that it would eventually drive you crazy
0	if you hold down the scroll wheel too long ( which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through ) , it will get stuck rapidly going through the songs and wo n 't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it
0	this product has virtually all the same installation problems
1	i do give create to creative for their attractive design
0	the major reasons i didn 't give it a five are one , i didn 't think the fine adjustment worked well
1	i love this player
1	good image quality
1	however , the ipod does not come close to the number of extra features that the 'zen micro ' has to offer
1	the click wheel is incredibly convenient , however it can be a little overly touchy at times , which will make you frustrated with your own fingers
0	the only not so positive comment i have is about the depth adjustment , it is not easy to micro adjust accurately
1	the depth adjustment and bit changing is much easier on the m12v than it was on my old router
1	the clarity is unbelievable , which means you can cram almost the full 2 , 5 !
0	this product is too fragile for normal use
0	2 it is bulky and the small buttons on the sides are sloppy to use
1	anything this phone does , it does perfectly
1	i found it intuitive to use ( i did n 't read any documentation for it and was using it successfully within a few minutes )
0	when i got it home , i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were n 't there
1	i liked this one enough to buy another
0	i then realized a major design flaw
0	most of us just want to plug and play , not spend a year navigating a maze of complicated options like transfering everything on a hard drive to this stupid thing
1	this is a quality product , not to be confused with the cheap junk that hitachi gets manufactured in china
0	now the bad 1 ) as usual , battery power not sufficient for daily usu age
1	i really have no complaints over this unit
1	but , then again , the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office , when i was already out on the street
0	the installation software cd crashed repeatedly
1	sound quality was the same between the two , but the zen did have more sound adjustments with the normal eax features
1	i don 't know if we 'll run into trouble down the road with odors , but so far i have no complaints and i 'm very happy not to have to buy those refills
0	the cut outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls , especially the scroll wheel
1	comes with a installation cd which instructs you step by step to setting up the router
0	my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote , which is worse than other , cheaper apex units
1	power for the tech savvy , ease of use for the less fortunate
1	it also holds a lot more diapers
1	the screen is quite big ( between all hand phone ) , but the just about 65000 color
0	and man i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title
1	it practically plays almost everything you give it
1	long live apple , long live macs , and long live the ipod !
1	and the slim form factor together with the mirror like front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey !
1	if you 're looking for a small , compact , super resolution digital camera , you can end your search with the nikon 4300 !
0	3 ) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer , like some players
1	overall , i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too
1	because this camera is beautiful
1	this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon never knew i could love a digital camera so much
1	the ! sound quality is great
1	i love the camera
0	even after reading some of the instructions , it 's still hard to figure out
1	i still need to read up on some of the security settings , etc to fully understand all that 's up there , but bottom line is that the installation was like night and day compared to the speed boost router
1	the panorama modes are wonderful
1	but i 've already emailed creative tech support about it , and gotten timely responses they will fix it for me if necessary
0	the sd500 has only been in my possession for a little over 3 months , and the lcd has been broken twice
1	and i must say this mp3 is very cool
0	scroll button the scroll wheel was a nice idea to keep less clutter , but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling
1	and we still love it !
1	there was no compromise this little camera does amazing things
0	there is not a word about satellite issues in either the user guide or the knowledge database at linksys com , and first tech support person i spoke with kept me on the phone for an hour , then gave me a web site address to consult that turned out to be the one i 'd already found during a search of my own
0	another problem is that the latest 2 0 firmware upgrade moves you into windows media player 10 which seems to be very , very slow for downloads charging 2
0	the dvd door would scratch the top of the disc every time it closed
1	i also love that you can flip the device with one hand
1	3 the remote capture and file viewer software bundled for photo capture is mind blowing
1	i can recommend this phone to anyone , anytime
1	as the 6600 uses 900mhz , it operates in more countries than the 6620
0	they last about 1 1 2 years until the problems start
1	the possibilities with auto , manual , and the very helpful scene mode , which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait , landscape , beach snow , sunset etc , are endless
1	it 's easier and much more convenient to use because it doesn 't have clumsy and confusing ( not to mention expensive ) refills
0	this version of internet security 2004 , is beyond hope
0	this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do n 't purchase it
0	i send my camera to nikon for servicing , took them a whole 6 weeks to diagnose the problem
0	creative labs customer support website is useless
0	however , it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my dix rips
1	the xtra improves upon the zen nx with a larger , now blue backlit screen , which is infinitely better
1	i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am very pleased
1	in a word , awesome is how i would describe this camera
1	one cabinet shop has been using one regularly in a router table for 11 years without a problem
0	also , the battery 's aren 't user replaceable
1	the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs to be charged while in the camera , but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery
1	initially , i was very impressed , after loading 180 songs it seemed to function very well but then it would lock up on me and a battery removal remedied this , i then downloaded the upgrades and everything seemed to be alright
1	since batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money saver since ipods , rivers , rca , dell , all have built in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement )
1	the soft start is nice
1	my experience with installation was quite good
1	2 ) the champ uses regular store bags
1	i prefer things that are simple
0	i already knew something was wrong , because much of the spam i 've seen in the past six months was from resellers of norton products
0	overall , it does its basic function very well , but we expect more from the mp3 players today and the zen micro does not rise to the occasion
1	the battery life seems good , takes very little time to charge , it uploads mp3s quickly and there is no delay between songs
0	again , the headphone jack on this thing is garbage
1	overall this is the best phone i have ever owned
1	the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry
1	while they all seem to have their own positives and negatives , i picked the zen micro over the ipod mini , because i am not an apple person , never has been i wanted something that is fully compatible with windows media player
0	the only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance
0	this dvd play is basically junk
1	i am very pleased with my purchase
0	the flaw is in the circuit board that the headphone jack is connected to
1	but if you use all bluetooth accessories , as i do , its really not an issue
1	finally , amazon 's free shipping is really getting good , it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me !
0	only slight negatives i 've had so far is that i haven 't been able to get it to accept any of my wav files yet
0	but be prepared to buy something else ( diaper genie ? ) which can trap the odor better
0	it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button
1	progressive scan player for a relatively low price ( although the better known manufacturers like toshiba , pioneer , and panasonic are now offering lower priced progressive scan players as well )
1	overall the ipod really is an almost flawless beast the capacity in the 20 gb is more than i think most people would ever need and , for the price , i highly recommend it
1	my first impression was positive
1	canon 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better
1	all in all suprisingly easy to use
1	the white led backlit lcd is very bright and crisp , even in sunlight , and relatively easy on the battery
0	i 'm giving it 1 star because as compared to other nokia phones , its a 1 , compared to other blunders by other companies ( such a samsung and motorola ) it might be good but if you 're getting a nokia , don 't get this one
0	it also has a stock tracking app built in ( also useless ) and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics ( currency , length , area , etc )
0	the one and most major thing that i was disappointed with , in this player , is the battery life
1	the sd500 rivals the canon g6 in image quality
0	the little bag it comes with is cheap and useless
1	sound quality ? phenomenal
0	and the battery life is bad !
0	it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ?
1	it is without even a slight doubt , my new favorite
0	and if you 're a mac user like me , they 've naturally made sure you have no viable alternative
0	i 've often struggled to get something to work the way i want it , and hate to have to carry the manual with me all the time !
1	it has an exterior design that combines form and function more elegantly than any point and shoot we 've ever tested
1	its a tough one this unless you wanna drive your car over it
0	i think it is a combination of the program size taking up resources and the open close scanning that it does with every program
0	es , the interface took a little getting used to , but once i did , it 's almost second nature now
1	the 30gb zen xtra rocks my socks , spills my beer , but does n 't wash my car
0	the only problem i had was a few components didn 't quite load correctly upon startup , but a reboot fixed the problem
1	its well made and user friendly
0	solid food poop is very stinky and this diaper pail doesn 't really contain the smell
0	gets stinky after a few months , the seal on the piston doesn 't seal anymore
0	if there was a zero star rating i would give it
1	touch ups , redeye , and so on are very easy to alter , and correct
1	the best part of the firewall is the visual backtracking
1	i 've been incredibly happy with this camera
1	the tiny ( postage stamp sized ) remote unit is wonderful not only does it trigger the shutter , it can also be used to zoom and review pictures
1	one it 's size it 's smaller than the ipod mini , and holds more music ( 5gb to the ipod mini 's 4gbs )
0	1 ) fragile ( i broke the 1st one within 10 days )
1	it fits comfortably in my hand and pocket
1	i can highly recommend this product because of its ease of use ( hardware and software ) , playback quality and value for the price
1	another 5 star performance
1	and it is very easy to clean
