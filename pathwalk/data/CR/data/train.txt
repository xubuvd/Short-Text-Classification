0	their site offers no live help at all
1	works pretty well
1	i was worried about what the sound quality would be like , but that seems to be just as good as the actual cd sound
1	the canon is very small , definitely pocket size , but still easy to hold firmly
0	back in may 2004 , when i first reviewed this , it had taken me over 16 hours to install and run
0	little to no networking experience , just in case the automatic cd method has issues
1	i dont know what other people are saying , but the software is awesome
1	very sturdy and strong
1	they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely ( as all of my pictures have thus far )
1	also , with one click you can help train your spam killer
1	the first one lasted about 6 years of heavy use
1	i got the diaper champ because of the great reviews as well as the fact that you can use regular garbage bags
1	i have no problems with the touch pad ( once the sensitivity is set to low ) and the interface is a breeze to use without even looking at the pdf manual
1	it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package
1	the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs , my entire collection of cd 's will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun
1	we have never had any problems with anything like loose wipes getting stuck ( we always wrap them in the dirty diaper )
1	3 band and you can just change the sim card in it to be able to use it in europe with another service provider
1	the ipod is a fine cousin to the early macs and current offerings from jobs and company
1	now that i own it , however , i can 't imagine being without it !
1	4 the build is just right
1	a sony erickson may be the phone for you but good luck finding one w all the features such a competitive price
0	only thing missing from creative is a cd burner
1	moving on to sound department it delivers !
0	hard drive screws up occasionally
1	no one has ever come to my house and noticed 'diaper odor '
0	this is extremely lame
1	i think the interface is great
0	got way too many blurry pictures
0	the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones
0	the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with canned air
1	the supplied headphones are hands down better than the mediocre ipod buds
0	but , i am quite unhappy with nokia at the moment
1	i highly recommend it
0	the only way my pc internet works is if i open the firewall program configuration and manually refresh it
0	on the downside , i think the interface takes some getting used to and the zen software !
0	all in all , trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing creepiness of this very embarassing gift
1	i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images
1	memory storage seemingly boundless
1	another plus in my book , no file limits !
1	this is my second digital camera , but i 'm much more impressed with the canon s100 digital elph than i ever was with my kodak dc240
0	of course , if you try to reach symantec customer service you get useless automated systems unless you want to pay 30 per incident
1	it comes with an adapter to plug into the wall , which i hear is a step up from the other ipods , which require you plug it into a computer to charge it
1	have not had any issues with the headphones or fragility
0	even the instruction booklet is out of order
0	the 2nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on
1	multimedia functions are enhanced by multi slide mms messages and a gallery for organizing digital content captured or downloaded with the phone
1	pros huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery
1	ooh , and i dropped it and it still works fine this little camera has so many features i have n 't even gotten to all of them yet
1	the headphone earbuds are average , so just use your regular pair instead
0	apparently , t mobile is heavily back logged and can 't keep up with demands
1	if you are looking for a phone to integrate as easily as the sonyericsson phones with isync , i say stick with a sonyericsson
0	the only beef that i have with it is that there is a little too much slop in the columns when the lock is not engaged
1	as it turns out , this is an awesome camera !
0	i registered for this item because of the good reviews it got , however i was not impressed
0	video recording is limited at just 9 seconds
0	the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well
1	it looks nice and sleek and the blue background light looks awesome against the black
1	i like the nomad 's color better , but it 's not terribly flashy
1	the actual experience of using the ipod is magnificent
0	so loud , really , that it does n 't work terribly well as a silent ringer option
1	it 'll make life a lot easier , and preclude you from having to give this product a negative review
1	having the digic ii chip helps a lot
0	if you currently own the 2003 version , and are looking to upgrade to the 2004 version , don 't
0	2 the scroll button is n 't the best , as it sometimes can be hard to select
1	there are extra features packed inside this unit ( some that most will hardly ever use ) such as fm radio tuner , voice recorder , calendar , and alarm clock
1	if you use software correctly , put in all the id3 tags , you will get an awesome database collection , from which you can easily access your songs
0	new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays
0	downside it takes a long time to start up
0	the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times
0	they have a good concept here , and i normally expect a lot better quality from creative , so maybe they will do better with the next gen version , but for now i say buyer beware
1	it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes
1	the software interface supplied was very easy to use but i went ahead and got red chair 's notmad software because of some advanced features i wanted
1	the nokia 660 runs the symbian os , which works pretty well for most standard phone fare , most of the stuff is not that intuitive , but if you actually learn how to use it all , there 's plenty of neat tie ins
0	this is a terrible company with a bad product and awful support
1	i want to start off saying that this camera is small for a reason
1	if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order
0	unit worked great for 3 weeks then video output failed
1	as i mentioned before , the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said , though notmad may still work better
0	it has a few inconveniences one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd
0	their network coverage is very sporadic , and the network always seems overloaded , resulting in very unpleasant calling experience
1	i have no problem using itunes with the zen micro ( in a makeshift sorta way )
0	i just uninstalled systemworks and internet security for at least the fifth time due to functionality issues
1	the fm tuner is just a little spare icing on the cake
1	i click pictures in jog format and because the phone has a bluetooth device i find it extremely easy to transfer pics to my pc and forth
1	the optical zoom is awesome , and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom
0	booting up my computer took forever ! ! !
1	i 've had this phone for almost a year now and it has been nothing but great to use
1	it looks sleek and modern
1	simple and it works !
0	i got about 700 loaded up before it told me i was full , and at that point , i was ready to toss it out the window
1	this program enables the user to batch convert and convert audio files from one format to another
1	give each friend a different ringtone
1	a lot of people complain about the creative software , but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes
0	it only read the dvds 10 of the time , otherwise i would get a no disc screen
1	i am so pleased with this product ! ! !
1	it fits into a hand well , it has a removable battery ( this is important ) , great sound quality , fm stereo , recorder , smooth ui , and a feature that most uni pods lack char !
1	all at the same time , and all without a hitch
1	just bought one i 've enjoyed it to date
0	only owned it about two weeks so i expect we 're looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon
1	we empty ours every day and we have never had an odors from it !
1	i really love this phone
1	oh , and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet
1	c i do love audio sync which allows a one click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer
0	do n 't buy this player
1	the card basically installed itself and the install wizard on the cd that came with the router basically set the router up to work with one computer ( with the 54g card ) and also a second computer in my house ( with an 11b card )
1	i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did
1	diaper champ is great
1	the sound is great , the portability , etc all the stuff you expect from a good mp 3 player , this zen micro has it
1	glad to see the ed revised the previous statements regarding image quality
0	battery compared to the other players on the market , the ipod has one of the worst batteries around
0	the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n 't have to reboot the computer or anything , just open up explorer again
0	the other annoyance with this that you have to remove every single remnant of previous version of norton systemworks before you installs this
1	so far , we 've only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine
1	great video clip quality for a digital camera so much better than my old one ( canon a60 ( ? ) the 2 0 megapixel one )
1	the combination of the price , storage size , and player features makes this player the best on the market
1	battery non issue
0	the collet for the 1 4 inch bits is a pain to get in and even harder to get out
1	i feel much less likely to drop this phone than others , which are actually starting to get too small
0	in other words , the zen is not a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1 for some sizing information )
1	creative did well on its rechargeable battery feature
1	5 ) bluetooth wireless technology , so that i can transfer data to and from my computer without messing with any cables
1	fortunately for me , i have yet to have a single problem with this player
1	not only is it much more cost effective ( you can use regular trash bags rather than refills at 5 a pop ) , it is easier to use and clean , and has a larger capacity
1	in summary , i love this camera and would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range
1	i imagine if i left my player untouched ( no backlight ) it could play for considerably more than 12 hours at a low volume level
1	1 the phone has the best keypad any nokia phone has to offer
0	the keys are close together , and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads , but it 's not too weird
1	but from my experience , by the time it gets to that point , the bag is really heavy , so i think this is kind of helpful it 's a built in way of keeping the bag manageable upon emptying
0	if you buying this player to use with napster to go , wait a while
1	when you turn on your player , the player turns on really fast , and the music continues to play , as you left it when you were turning it off
1	oh and file transfers are fast easy
1	great screen and great sound
1	whichever it may be , i 'm happy i 've made this purchase
1	it has great battery life , fm radio , excellent signal , hands free speakerphone ( which i have to say is probably my favorite function ) and downloadable java apps
1	i chose this one because from what i read , it was the best deal for the money
0	their customer ( www apex digital inc com ) service is very poor
0	but i had to give you four because the service for my brand new ipod was terribly slow
1	all and all , i am extremely pleased with this camera
1	this thing seriously is a good player though
0	i also own a canon digital rebel and i agree that the advanced controls on the sd500 are not as robust , but overall picture quality goes head to head with the digital rebel
1	however , the battery life is good enough you should n 't be overly concerned with turning this phone off
1	the player looks so much better when you 're actually holding it
0	scroll button more cumbersome than on earlier models
1	the screen is large and bright and has all the info i need where i need it
0	especially the bluetooth server meaning you have to restart the phone if you want bluetooth to work again
0	you must keep double checking depths
1	i got it to use with the new 5 per month service from yahoo ( music unlimited , ) and despite the above issues , i love it
1	while this phone obviously doesn 't have the same quality construction as motorola does , the nokia 6600 is one of the better phones i 've used
1	this is the best camera you can have for digital images if you want to
1	i have not yet used all the features , like the calendar , etc , but as a music player this little thing rocks
1	it 's so small and light , even with a spare battery , you really can take it anywhere
0	i am giving a zero star to symantec for this version !
1	the ringtones are beautiful , the screen is super high quality
1	the height is a more convenient reach than others , where you have to hunch over
0	however , i do n 't like to carry it on my belt because the clip is n 't secure and the case can slip off
1	the more i work with it , the more i love it !
0	no matter how accustomed to the phone you become , too much time is required to get to , open and close applications
1	yet after ensuring that all the id3 tags are in order ( with the software which is actually not as bad as people make it out ) it actually turns out to be really handy
1	the song quality of the ipod is excellent , and the included ear buds are actually more than satisfactory , for most users
0	had there been strange noises , or obvious defects , i would have accepted a replacement , but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches
0	customer service awful listen to this one , remember the battery statement i made earlier
0	the user support service isn 't too great either
1	it has given me zero problems , and the more i use it , the better i become at taking advantage of its strengths
0	negatives of the player itself you need to do a little work before having full enjoyment of this player
1	if i had to do it over again , even with the cost savings of using any type of bag , i would go w the diaper genie
1	it 's easy to transfer , preview , and organize files
1	you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( sound presets , navigating options , playlists , etc )
1	i don 't believe this camera is still available but if you can find one , you might like to get it
1	i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine
0	c ) the scroll bar is a travesty enough said
1	and so far , i have been very , very happy with my zen micro
0	it sends discontinuous signals to tv , so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment
1	no more banner ads , pop ups , and the reliable antivirus
0	operation it 's like bmw 's i drive it does it 's job , but has the most unintuitive , overly layered interface
1	5 ) its focusing system is also very flexible
1	overall the nikon 4300 is a very dependable , robust , and useful little camera
0	the headphones are n 't the best , but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity
0	now it will start smelling if you leave it with diapers in it for an extended period but all of them will !
1	i had a sony ericsson t610 before this and the t610 is far inferior
1	it 's a compact , attractive machine and was easy to set up
0	i gave up and got a diaper decor
0	2 ) phone is awfully slow
0	it does take some getting used to
0	the ipod mini is smaller and sexier , albeit limited in supported formats and the rio karma is a far better value
1	smooth plunging mechanism
1	as a whole , the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine
1	i did not conduct a rigorous test , but just took some identical shots in identical lighting with both cameras , and the canon won hands down
1	price , along with the replaceable battery ( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace as well as the hassle of returning it ) were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad
1	well i have to say that this product is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket
1	in terms of the shots taken , this camera is insanely great !
0	namely , it wouldnt sync
1	i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly , but there 's no difference in working with the files
0	purchased the ad 2600 about a month ago and have had numerous problems with it
0	enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n 't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem
1	2 ) storage capacity
1	great sound , very long battery life ( i routinely play it for 12 hours ) , very fast recharges rate , removable battery , storage size , nice screen , firmware updates , and great price
1	well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player ( at that size and the price )
0	not so nice things a bit too much weight and power for easy handheld use spindle lock makes for awkward bit changing ( outside of a table ) the 1 4 chuck sleeve requires much tightening to keep bits from slipping
0	some features in the user interface
1	technology wise , i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great ! ! ! ! i love this phone ! ! !
0	i tried called apex cu st service , no help
1	the wrt54g plus the hga7t is a perfect solution if you need wireless coverage in a wider area or for a hard walled house as was my case
0	i added a crank for those times when i need to make fine adjustments , but i seldom use it
0	pc cable is too expensive 50 for a usb cable ?
1	of course , i was hesitant given the price , but i 've been extremely impressed since receiving it , and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents
1	track , name , artist , album and genre is automatically retrieved via internet labeled , and properly categorized into the zen
1	they take excellent macro shots as well
1	i am able to carry it close to my body , in places where other phones are not so easily concealed
1	even did while daughter sleep and no noise !
1	so once i worked out the problem with the software this mp3 player is worth the money it cost
0	the keypad is a decent size , but the power on off key is small and difficult to press
1	we are overall pleased with product
1	first 4 months it was in our bedroom and we did not even smell any odor
0	1 ) frame freezes and the family yells , dad ! somethings wrong with the dvd player ! come quick !
1	i wanted standard memory expansion ( cf cards ) , macro mode , and if possible , a waterproof housing ( for kayaking )
1	this player seems to work fine with everything else
1	for looks , well ipod is head and shoulders better , both the iriver and creative zen look positively ugly when next to a gleaming ipod
1	i did n 't think i would find this quality and ease of use for under 1500 i 'm thrilled with my purchase !
0	after two weeks the picture kept freezing
0	we tried the finding memo dvd and when we got to chapter 28 , the frames started to freeze for no reason
1	overall , if you know what basic steps to take , it was not difficult to connect , and the s w worked well to connect
1	nokia was my first non flip phone , and i 'm glad i decided to go with them
1	their website had a download that helped remove those , although i had to manually remove a good number of files from the programs directory
1	my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature
0	they obviously have quality and reliability problems
1	i have never had an odor problem !
0	i have noted that as you use the tool , sawdust builds in the channel and it requires attention
0	i also did n 't like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode
1	i bought the diaper champ and have been very happy for the following reasons
0	norton support is completely pathetic
0	in addition , i do not think the battery lasts much more than eight to ten hours , and it can take four hours for a full charge
1	many of these programs are shareware , some can be purchased by paying a little bit of bucks
1	probably a great phone overall , and perhaps mine just has bugs
1	on the t mobile service i was able to take pics as we drove across i 70 and email them to family friends once we reached a t mobile tone ( usually a major city )
1	even the battery life is great it advertises 14 hours , it 's actually a little less but still good
0	in noisy environment , it 's hard to hear from the earpiece
1	i must say , i think this is the coolest camera i 've ever owned !
1	the battery life is amazing
1	although it has chubby hips , the device isn 't really so big
1	the g3 looks like a work of art !
1	the champ did not start letting a little odor through until well over a year
0	bluetooth does not work on this phone
0	the program brings more problems than a virus , albeit not as major problems , just not what you expect for 70 bucks
1	this makes for a great phone
0	there is absolutely nothing useful at the symantec norton site
1	smaller size , 1 gb of more space , radio , voice recording , removable battery , cooler look , all in one
1	i have been impressed with the power of the hitachi m12v
1	i am enjoying my phone a lot
1	but you can download some really good ones like pac man or mafia wars
1	also , it was only 39 99 ( after rebate ) with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player
1	ability to play most discs i tried dvd , vcd , dvd r , audio cd and it played all
0	also , for those that complain that the diaper champ isn 't as effective as time passes , keep the following in mind as babies get older , their diets changes ( aka solid foods ! ) and so does the smell of their diapers !
0	who knows how many uses you 'll get out of it before it craps out , but it probably will
0	this phone is not suitable for fast people , maybe only for old people
0	the only problem i had was a small glitch with t mobile
0	it is buggy , slow and basically frustrates the heck out of the user
1	i am very pleased so far
0	if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred , you will become frustrated quite quickly
1	the screen 's large and easily read
1	this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range , or like me , do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones
1	for the money , i 'm not sure you can do better
1	fm radio built in ( howard stern )
0	i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work
1	this router has soft start and runs smooth and true
0	1 pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance
1	seriously , this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want
1	i loved this product when i first got it great sound , easy to use ( even though i agree that the software was n 't the best ) and held enough songs to suit any mood
1	this camera was affordable , very easy to learn , and produces spectacular images
1	i felt better with this one since it had the shuffle feature and i 'm not too keen on www ipod 's dirty secret com
1	i hooked the linksys wireless router up to a broadband connection which is running at a maximum of 700 plus kilobytes on the download e !
0	you need the software to actually transfer files
1	all in all , this is the camera for you if you can spare the extra cost in price
1	all of the wireless components that i bought were a breeze to set up as well
1	i love all of the features , and presets as well
1	the base was deeper and the highs were crisper
0	it 's a rip off if one buys norton internet security and antivirus
0	lens cap is a really annoying
1	in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset
0	why would anyone buy this when you can get a 20gb ipod that will hold 4 times the number of songs ( and even more if aac encoding is used ) for the same price ? ? ?
0	customer service and technical support are overloaded and non responsive tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them
1	overall it is the best camera on the market
1	i like the speak phone function a lot
1	i downloaded a trial version of computer associates ex firewall and antivirus and fell in love with a computer security system all over again
0	i would give it about 6 or 7 hours , although it will probably get better after a few charge cycles
1	you won 't need to update your firewall and antivirus separately or install two disks
1	in auto mode anyone can use it as a point and shoot camera
0	the touch controls took a little getting used to but now i wouldn 't change it for the scroll wheel
1	the battery lasts very long when playing music , but writing files to the player drains the battery fast , so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files
1	transfering mp3s are a cinch with the included software
1	i have transferred in about 2 , 400 tracks so far very easy to use both the ipod and itunes
0	wo n 't play a lot of discs
1	but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player , get the nomad
0	i only have one complaint , and that is the 8mb card included
1	i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied
1	i like the auto fit feature you can stretch wide screen dvd 's to normal
0	the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do
1	nice things about the m12v in a table , the powerful 3 1 4 hp motor is great soft start helps a lot to control the beast when you turn the router on continuously variable speed control amazon 's price
1	right out of the box , i loved it , better features than the ipod , great sound quality and no limitations on what music sources i can use
0	apple closed their island to anything that resembled microsoft , and clearly let napster know it could not use their products with napster 's services
1	but at least you re starting with the most photo realistic images ive ever seen from a camera
0	there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open ( my perv machine did it automatically ) , and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance
1	while i would like to give it 3 5 stars instead of 4 , i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it
0	after 10 years , i now downloaded mccaffee 's product after calling their support they answered quickly , and for free , and were very helpful
0	last , i find the price a bit expensive for a product such as this
0	i find this feature on this phone useless , but , since i don 't really need this function anyway , i don 't really use it
1	it offers way more features than i need but the ones i use work well
1	if you 'll only read the whole manual , you 'll find out even more cool features and you 'll learn how to manipulate the quality you want to achieve and all those modes will make sense after reading
0	i tried to contact apex to return it ( i missed the amazon return period ) and it took 3 months to get through to their customer service dept
1	the memory card fit nicely since i also have a pocket pc and it automatically installed a picture software on my pda willa
1	in low light with flash i found it clear better then the sony p200 ( too much red , colours overall not as natural but fewer red eyes )
1	it is so small that i am able to keep it in my pocket , and i don 't have to fear that it will get ruined in my pocket because it is so durable
1	this is the mp3 player with everything i need as long as it lasts me a good three years , i 'm satisfied
0	when you look through the viewfinder ( not the lcd ) the bottom left corner of the picture ( about 15 ) is blocked by the lens
0	it is slightly larger than an ipod , no doubt about it
0	i would imagine this is a problem with any camera of a compact nature
1	what makes the focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8
1	nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception
0	the battery issue is superficially a concern , but any reasonable solder jockey ( such as myself ) can pop in a new one when the time comes ( based upon the plentiful info gained from a go ogle for 'ipod battery replacement ' )
0	it did also seem to have a strong new electronics smell for some time
1	and best of all , no wasting money on special refill bags this takes ordinary garbage bags !
0	minor complaints 1 ) even though the music is sorted via id3 tag on the player , the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable
0	finally , making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually , and are organized by cd , which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order
0	no option for caller id pictures or individualized ringtones
1	even during the firmware updates my roommates did not loose wireless connectivity
1	record memos using the built in microphone
1	speed is not a problem
1	creative has put a lot of effort into making this player appeal to those true geeks that search for coolness and functionality in electronic devices
0	i am glad that i do not work for norton
1	fits well in hand in trouser pockets
1	to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player
0	i took my zen micro with me over the weekend , and was forced to lug my laptop with me on the trip for one reason to keep the zen micro charged
0	i tried to do this by instinct and it 's not intuitive unless you are a network geek
1	overall , i 've been very impressed with the player
1	i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i 've used before
1	the product has worked perfectly for me on my xp
0	i have ice age and it keeps telling me no disc
1	it does n 't smell like burning plastic when you open the drive
0	no problems now , just a sickly disappointment in the way norton has abandoned their customers
1	the buttons and interface are very easy to use
0	they have the worst service of any of the major companies
0	8 buttons are little , but if you have steady fingers and deal ed with a casio worst calculator watch , you can deal with almost anything
1	it came with a good fence that is simple yet precise and thats well made and won 't break
1	you can take pic of your friends and the picture will pop up when they call
1	given that i already have the zen the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software
1	i still can 't believe how fast it starts up
0	a bit disappoint on that !
0	the battery does not last 12 hours
0	once a depth is locked , it will jump off a little while working
1	when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there it is unbelievably small and oh , so light
1	original review december 2004 i 'm sorry to read about other people having problems with their zen micro , but mine has worked great !
1	the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used
1	the software is very easy to use , and the transfer is super fast !
1	better for the zen micro is outlook compatibility
1	i love the es based controls and easy menus
0	also , the fit and finish could be better although this doesn 't detract from performance
0	who in the hell needs a frigging vga camera on their cellphone ? ? ?
0	the flash is very weak
0	its quiet
1	all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well
0	the back of the ipod is in a chrome finish , and this surface is prone to scratches
0	i will never buy their product again at this rate , and neither should you
1	this is a really great buy , for yourself or as a shower gift
1	look at the size of it !
0	unfortunately , creative offered scant few pages of instruction , which meant that i was on own from the outset
1	the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone unlike the nokia 3650 and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make
0	loading cds was somewhat time consuming , but i think it would have been with the ipod as well
1	i 've connected the phone with two laptops and a ipa 4155
0	i did n 't abuse it , i charged it every day , but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out
1	i 'd say that this camera is perfect
1	anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception
1	first and foremost , it will take better pic 's than most film camera 's
1	i 've yet to find the limitation for this hitachi ( my only hitachi tool , by the way ) and quite frankly , i don 't know that i have the muscle to push this machine any harder
1	the bags attach inside the champ easily and all one has to do is cram the diaper down and flip the handle
1	the included fence guide is easy to set up and quite accurate as well
1	my brother had an old linksys b band wireless router in his home and it was like magic
1	as said before this works perfectly
0	i 've searched the program and their online tech support ( worthless ) and have found no solutions
0	do n 't buy this player
1	installation was as near automatic as can be
0	after attempting to navigate the clumsy touch pad system , i could not get the unit to download my wma files
1	you indefinitely appreciate the small size
1	by the way , i use the norton 2003 corporate at work with absolutely no trouble
1	6600 looks and feels nice
1	remote you can stand it on end ( harder to lose ) , and it 's far better designed than the 1100s
1	when i saw a high gain ( low price ) antenna was available to the wrt54g router , i thought i 'd happily give up some ( practically unattainable anyway , since you 've got to be in spitting distance from the router ) speed in favor of wider coverage
1	the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad
1	controls easy yo use and easy to get to
1	so far , the anti spam feature seems to be very good
0	the top did not fit well into the unit ( felt defective )
1	silver metal case not plastic
0	also the feature to automatically put in the song information is n 't always accurate
1	it is slow to initially start up , but once it 's turned on , i 've never had any complaints about the speed
1	each battery lasts about 10 11 hours
0	what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds
0	when i tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house , that one didn t work either !
1	6 ) the phone is really wide , which seems to be a turnoff for many people , but the phone is actually easier to grip and feel more ergonomic
0	the scroll wheel , to be blunt , sucks
0	images taken indoor were n 't so clear
0	i can 't tell you how many times i 've chipped a nail or hurt my fingertips because of the force needed to open it
0	the only thing i don 't like about it is that you have to buy a larger memory card , first thing !
1	all the good reviews for the sd500 are true
1	if you need a wireless router get it get it get it works really good
1	i got this camera about a month ago and i can 't put it down
0	it seems like the software is just not responding
1	using supplied s w , you can transfer all addresses from a different nokia phone into it
1	the micro has an impressive array of very nice features and a well designed user interface
0	the new drivers on cannon 's site do not help at all but try them if you want they have made me have to use the backup software
1	in minutes i was easily navigating through the menus
1	the battery has a long life
1	transfering is easy , the software makes everything pretty easy
1	i 've now had the camera for two months and i 'm even more pleased with it
1	compatibility with other devices is excellent too i 've only found one 11b device that won 't work with its mixed mode ( and it won 't work with anyone 's mixed mode )
1	a distinct ipod relation is evident with white colored cables , power plug and the very nice zen case with a white rubber inside covering
1	the battery is removable
0	nothing but hassle with this company
1	the battery life is very good , i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time , the first time around , and i have been using it with the lcd off every now and then , and have yet needed to recharge it
0	some people have commented about the size and weight of the phone , and it has rightfully gotten the nick name the bar of soap which , it really is
0	remote buttons are small and closely spaced , especially with the menu buttons
0	i had a lot of problems setting it up , since the software given along with it is buggy
1	when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n 't moving , the photos were awesome
1	great camera , and for the price you can 't beat it
1	i 'm sure i don 't use it to the degree of some of the other purchasers , but i really like it !
0	it does n 't have firewire , not a real complaint since most windows users do n 't generally have firewire cards themselves
0	the included memory card is too small
1	i like the automatic key lock function
1	light , compact design
1	comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit , included , is fast and small
0	imagine my disappointment , though , when the zen micro proved able to play only the mega strongest fm signals in my area
1	compared to musicmatch , the software has a better filing system and easier to use
1	another good feature is that you can charge the battery by just connecting the player to your computer using the usb cable
1	3 ) joy stick for eazy navigation , 35mb memory card to store the pictures and stuff
0	when i went to put in the new sd card i looked at the lcd screen cracked and the fluid gave a jackson pollock type appearance to the screen , black and blue and purple blotches and streaks useless
1	without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image !
0	the touch pad does take a little getting used to
0	the only thing i do n 't like about this is the cover does suck
0	a larger memory card and extra battery are good things to buy
1	whether you 're taking a brisk jog , waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park , you 'll be glad you had the fm radio
0	the os is ab it confusing at 1st , but within a few days you will pass this learning curve !
1	i am quite happy with the camera
1	having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos
0	this camera keeps on outfoxing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can 't be stopped
1	additionally , it has more fun stuff like more tones , wallpapers , screen saver , stop clock , alarm , java applications ( chess , currency converter etc )
0	basically , i ate the cost of the renewal and ate the cost of the tech help
1	the movie mode is also working great
1	well backlit keypad
1	the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi pro pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography
0	to install that version you have to uninstall from the window registery anything called symantec or nortron , also from the common files in the program folder the symantec folder has to be deleted
0	but the earbuds suck !
1	works great !
1	way to go apple !
0	i will never buy a creative product again
0	i don 't know what 's happened to norton , but 2004 is absolute garbage
1	) the zen micro appears sturdy and well constructed , hefty , if you will , far better than many of its competitors
1	i gave the zen 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 's not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class
1	the color screen is a plus , as are the polyphonic ringtones
0	don 't buy the diaper champ
0	all i have to say is that i did freeze on me once , but it has n 't done it since
1	this is the best dvd player i 've purchased
0	of course one of the first things i did was write an email to the customer support at creative , through their website , and by the time they finally got back to me several working days later when they promise only one their suggestions were completely worthless
1	and the tech writers have made the installation process so easy for people lick my aunt to follow
1	this camera is so easy to use !
1	first , the battery is replacable by the user , because creative intended it to be unlike apple with the ipod
0	the box proudly displays securest ( tm ) wireless made simple one touch setup button easy start easy security easy everyday apparently linksys cisco knows that ease of setup is crucial
1	it is very light weight and has a good signal strength
1	the same 4mp chip from the 4500 camera , plus a 3x zoom with the ability to expand upon that with extenders , great closeup mode , long lasting rechargable battery , etc etc
1	great product , easy to use , economical , effective , absolutly fabulous
0	i still like it a lot and am not changing it for another , but it is sort of stinky
1	great price
0	is not as intuitive as i would like
0	yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion ( i do n 't like it too but no harm done since i always use the cam ea lcd screen to see exactly what i 'm going to get ) in the viewfinder when you do n 't zoom ( when you zoom the lens distortion goes away ) , canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon that is what lamest exactly ot the picture
1	fyi , battery doesn 't die if you don 't use lcd
0	my ipod freezes occasionally , which is especially annoying when you 're in the middle of a game of brick
1	so much packed in a small case and very affordable !
1	the sound is very nice
0	however , the calls constantly drop in my area and i experience mega static , to the point where i 'd have to dial numbers 6 7 times to get a clear line
1	overall small , sounds great , and less expensive than apple 's overpriced ipod !
1	the diaper champ turns the smelly diaper into what diaper smell in less time than that
1	this is easy to work and easy to dispose of the dirty diapers
0	also , the instruction manual is very bad
1	the hitachi is made in malaya , and looked cheap compared with the makita , which is made in the usa
1	i have ripped over 100 songs from my cd collection and it was so easy and fast , and they all sound great
1	b fast mediasource cd ripping takes about 40 seconds for a cd on my pentium 4 pc ( 2 4 hz with 1gb ram ) with 52x drive
0	there were no other obvious setup instructions though there was a soft copy manual , it did not give an answer readily on what do to
1	overall the phones fantastic , and i would have given it 5 stars , but its not perfect
0	they play just about everything , but 2 and 3 died very shortly after getting them
0	the player feels very delicate , as if i 'm holding an actual hard drive
1	best of all the wmas ( i have a lot of them ) sound great
1	settings for just about everything , beautiful pics and beautiful prints
1	very good every day camera fits nicely in the pocket of my jeans and takes quality photos
1	i think , apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price
1	no offense to amazon , but i was able to find one online for just over 200 bucks ( i 'm sure prices here will continue to sink ) , and that also seemed quite a good bargain for the amount of storage space
1	otherwise , this player is awesome !
0	you hit the message button on the front and it takes a matter of seconds to bring up the menu
0	two , the single wrench just doesn 't work well
0	the battery life leaves a lot to be desired
1	the nokia 6600 is a decent extension of the smart phone line
1	uploading music is quick and easy
1	believe me when i say this i have used and fingered all nokia phones and the 6600 has the best keypad
0	the zen does n 't support folders so it is not really a storage device even with third party software that creates folders , documents and programs can 't be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it 's a storage device at best
0	the karma doesn 't look as sexy but it 's interface is very efficiently designed
1	great quality picture and features
1	the eax features are pretty cool , as well , as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that , for example , compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train
1	aside from a 6mb built in phone memory , there 's a 32mb mmc card that goes with it !
1	speaking of battery , it 's removable and replaceable !
1	sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference
1	also , you can store data on it , which is a plus for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod , do n 't bother , this is a much better buy
0	there are 2 things that need fixing first is the battery life it will run for 6 hrs without problems with medium usage of the buttons
1	turn the camera on while pressing the button ( or is it the menu button ? i have to check again ) ) and it 'l show you the time and date
0	there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient
1	im a more happier person after discovering the i p button !
0	then , my ad pop up blocking was completely gone
0	3 ) the lack of an intermediate resolution setting , as other reviewers have suggested , is a problem , but that problem is meaningless with a larger compactflash memory card
1	it does well in all aspects of internet browsing
1	two it has a removeable rechargeable battery , so you don 't have to send the thing in when the re !
0	however after just one month my headphone jack was broken as a result of normal , every day use
1	also , the nomad 's 14 hours of battery life versus 8 is handy
1	i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now , and i am very happy with it
0	i no longer use it as a plunge router , only as a stationary or table mounted router
0	i see many other reviews that say the same stay away from norton , they don 't deserve you , or anyone !
0	i occasionally flip songs while working out as i accidently hit the pad even lightly ( yes i have it in maximum desensitized mode )
1	saw the hitachi on amazon com with their 25 00 coupon ( at the time ) and could not resist trying it out
1	i purchased two of these beauties
0	if you think you are saving 40 getting the hitachi , you are right , and you are also getting a router worth 40 less than a makita
0	if this machine just stops on you , unplug it quickly and get out of the way !
0	00 good though , and the zen does have a few drawbacks
0	the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did n 't notice after first day
0	i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts , and both were bad
0	the scroll bar problems make the task of creating playlists more frustrating
1	i love this product !
1	very simple to use
0	this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks
0	the touchpad is annoying sometimes ( give me the click wheel and pres sable buttons any day ) , but not at all as difficult to get over as other people are saying
1	battery life is good for a phone of this size
1	when it came down to it , the price on this player is hard to beat
0	since zen does not have an external antenna it has some problems catching weak signals but it works
0	i was a little disappointed in the low end
1	the sound quality is excellent and the speaker phone couldn 't be easier to use
1	i highly recommend a nokia 6610
0	as i wrote , this could have been a great product , but expect hidden charges ( read gross profiteering and price gouging ) as the company royally sticks you on every conceivable accessory necessary for normal daily usage
0	unfortunately , the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming
1	the small size is perfect for my little hands , but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person
0	it 's perfect for those who aren 't planning on storing tons of music
1	solid , squeak free , large screen
0	my jpeg pictures are viewable ( not so sharp and vivid ) on my 27 screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17 monitor
1	it is amazingly small , it 's hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera
0	software definitely sucks , hangs up my notebook about half the time , but i do n 't mind buying notmad
0	there is no fm tuner , while there is no fm tuner on the creative zen ( on the micro version of the zen there is a tuner ) , the iriver h10 20gb , the rio karma , and the audio x5 have fm tuners
1	this phone is a winner
1	using the software itunes is relatively simple , you just plug the usb cable in , wait your machine to detect the ipod and voila , any songs listed in your itunes library will be transfer ed on over to the ipod
0	i have noticed an odor ( one the i expected ! ) when unloading the diaper champ but at least you don 't smell anything every time you use it
0	i can 't rate it one star only because when it does work it 's pretty good
1	it sits in the corner of our bathroom and we have never had any problems with odors at all ( and we live in the damp and humid south , where odors of all kinds are generally rife )
0	within one month , my player completely died
0	features really , there aren 't any features , unless you call the games a feature
1	i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer !
1	fact is , it could n 't be easier to use
1	i bought my zen micro three months ago mainly because i preferred the size and style to the ipod mini
1	the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there
1	usb 2 0 very fast
0	does not recognize player at random times , despite being connected and displaying player 's library
1	i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but on full size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive
1	has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range
1	after upgrading the drivers and firmware a few times and e mailing tech support for some setting tips it now works fine
1	however , its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70 of the shots that i take
1	on the positive side , the sound of the player is pretty good , once you have everything configured
0	we also had a problem with diaper wipes getting caught when the top was flipped
1	unarguably better than apple 's , and nice earbuds to boot
0	only thing i don 't like about it is slow in changing apps , boot up , and sometime it has problem connect thru bluetooth
1	battery a big big plus
1	the zen micro is no exception in addition to the case , it comes with a neck strap , and has all of the necessary cables for syncing and charging
1	i actually purchased two phones recently ( this one at the new blackberry phone ) , and this one is far superior ( imho )
1	this camera is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer
0	1 ) a spare battery would have been great
1	i love the continuous shot mode , which allows you to take up to 16 pix in rapid succession great for action shots
1	also , you have to use it with itunes or they 'll sue , dammit ! but itunes is about as good as anything
1	this router acts as a wireless access point , 100 mb switch and a router making it a nice multipurpose device
1	like it 's predecessor , the quickly revised nx , this player boasts a decent size and weight , a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags , and excellent sound ( widely known to be better than ipod not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business )
1	well the champ has survived it 's first year with our son and it is great ! !
0	i had to return the remote on this product because it appeared to be defective
1	so i can 't tell you if diaper champ will be as good at containing the formula generated poop smell , but it 's excellent at containing the smell of poop of my breastfed baby !
1	the manual modes give you a lot of control over exposure and white balance ( but there is no manual focus or manual exposure )
1	i use it in the table ( never take the springs out just attach the fine adjustment knob ) , in my woo drat and freehand and it works great in all circumstances
1	and it fits right in my pocket much easier than my old s30
1	among my requirements for a phone were good screen , decent camera , bluetooth , and gprs support
1	and also , it 's priced very afford ably
0	but about 25 of dvd 's i 've played on it have a problem , when watching a movie the picture will freeze , but the dvd still plays , and eventually the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments
1	we have been using our diaper champ for almost 14 months now and we are very happy with it
0	first , the player did not allow me to access the menus of dvds
0	we bought this about 6 months ago and it 's been worthless
0	1 no direct firewire to the camera
1	i decided to go with the diaper champ rather than the more popular diaper genie , because i didn 't like the idea of having to buy special bags
1	everything i wanted ! the apple ipod has become one of the most sought after electronic gadgets and for good reason
1	all in all this a great player that blows the i pod away , with easy to use and understand features , software that is simple to understand and use , and a great sound ( which is all that matters in a mp3 player )
1	in conclusion , this player is beautiful
1	software is easy to use ( although red hat software is better , but costs money )
1	excellent diaper disposal unit
1	there are better cameras but none anywhere near as light and compact
1	one neat thing i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms no problem for the camera rooms looked like they had ample lighting
0	i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing
1	for the price , it 's a very nice dvd player
1	it 's far better than all others on the market
0	first , it serious , serious installation problems
1	for a price that 's still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster , and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some
1	the macro mode works well , although it takes some practice since the camera doesn 't clearly indicate when it can 't focus
1	sunset feature takes incredible pics in the morning , and the evening !
0	i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual
1	the guide fence for freehand routing is well made and solid
1	applications it has lots of applications and they work very well when you eventually find where they are and they finally open
1	the 4300 is a very durable , compact package , and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust
1	i am just in love with this phone , especially after using a more primitive phone about 3 years
1	can 't beat carrying 500 cd collection with me wherever i go
1	3660 had similar features , but that is big in size
1	the setup works awesome , as with any tool i look closely at the individual tool for it 's merits , and not just the company as a whole
0	unfortunately i was wrong
1	also , i am quite partial to the creative mediasource organizer and player software , which i had with audigy zs sound card originally it is definitely an added plus
1	you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call
1	the software is quick easy to use i found the entire process very easily mastered
0	i am an it professional and have used norton for years , but this product is a complete and utter dud
1	i bought it for my trip to buns aries , and also used it at the iguassu falls , and could not have asked for more perfect performance !
0	once again it won 't reinstall , even with online and email assistance from symantect technicians
0	yeah i agree the earbuds are pretty crap , replace them
0	because of this , i am disappointed and would not recommend this product
1	i do n 't always care for gracenotes ' genre listings but it allows easy editing of id3 tags
1	the handsfree provided by the phone is useful for those who talk on the phone while driving
1	apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players
1	i 've had this player for more than 4 months and i 'm very happy with it
1	the more i use it and figure out how to do things , the more i like it
0	it it is a bit heavy for hand held work , but any router this size will be
1	don 't care about sunlight it 's tft
1	it has a classic design yet looks hip
0	sometimes , various applications crash
1	this is enough capacity and capability to do a complete household inventory , for example
1	the i pod is the best thing i have ever used
1	the price performance looked just right
0	i had much of the same problems that everyone else has listed ( mainly the slow processor ) , and then i couldn 't get the damn thing off my computer completely !
0	the software , which comes with player is not good at all
1	it is lightweight , sleek and attractive
0	i was impressed by this very inexpensive player for the first three hours , and then it died
1	broadband hooked up to this wireless setup flies
1	first , it really is tiny the size of a pack of cigarettes , maybe a scotch deeper
1	value comparing data storage with price
1	the player works well with my sony srs a 202 powered speakers
1	the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures
1	the wrt54g offers excellent security features and much more ( and easier ) configuration menu that i didn 't even need a manual to setup correctly
1	itunes can be downloaded from the enclosed cd or for free from the apple site
1	we 've never experienced odor from the pail
0	it was a symantec error
0	if there were any complaints i have , they are marginal , but one is apples ' proprietary set up for music files , their incompatibility with other music services ( i e napster ) is down right wrong
1	it 's easy to use , and yet very feature rich
0	my fast forward button works , but it takes a little extra pressure on it to make it go
1	its compact and has rounded edges
0	also as someone who at least knows a little bit about the technical work of taking a photo i really miss having manual controls
1	it fits comfortably in my shirt pocket and while very well designed , doesn 't look to ostentatious while i 'm walking around with it
0	i find the major problem with this item is that if you have a very messy diaper and can 't tightly bundle it without a mess , the mess gets all over the module that dumps the diaper and the stink is outside of the diaper pail
1	the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging
1	in fact , it supports the new wpa encryption standard , which is way better than wep
1	canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out
1	i 've had it for about a week now and have to say it 's one of the best purchases i 've ever made
1	i 'm staying with sprint , and though i fear that their csr is n 't nearly as good as t mobile 's , the clarity of their reception is exceptional
1	huge storage space , i loaded my entire collection of music , which isnt that much , 400 songs , and still have 26 gb , out of the 28 provided to you
1	this is a great deal , and i 'm elated with my decision to go with hitachi 's green machine
1	the panorama setting is unbelievable !
0	so , right out of the box i had issue
0	there is little meaningful difference between the two versions aside from the tedious activation process , and the product is currently rather buggy and has problems running unless cleanly installed on a formatted drive
0	the outlook syn ch only works for non recurring appointments , which personally is very annoying to me but probably wont be to most people
1	replacement battery is 50 compared to ipod 's 150
0	the viewfinder does not accurately represent the picture being taken
1	i have a tendency to do quite a bit of research before i drop money on a tool and everyone i talked to loved this router
1	( every now and then i spray down the inside of the pail with lysol ) easy one hand use impossible for my inquisitive child to get the dirty diapers out of the pail every now and then odors do escape the pail , but that is rare and it usually just means that we 've crammed too much in there and need to change the bag
1	firewire usb2 0 for those fortunate enough to have firewire400 , your in for a real treat with auto sync
1	the buttons are easy to use , and its easy to navigate
1	all the buttons necessary lil ' gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand
1	love the speaker phone
0	a lot of people are having problems with the firmware update required to use the player for napster to go the firmware is beta and they are are a lot of bugs in it
1	likewise , i 've heard norton 2004 professional version is fine too
1	friends told me that the diaper genie did not work very well , so bought the diaper champ based on on line reviews and i have been happy with it
1	playlists can be generated on the fly ( which is a bit clunky but still a really nice bonus ) or by using the software , and there are a bevy of eq options
1	the software was great , as long as you have an administrative user account ( windows xp )
0	i had the second one for less than two weeks when i noticed a rattling humming buzzing sound while music was played
1	the software runs smooth , it 's nice to look at , it 's very organized , easy to follow and makes things very simple
1	it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly
1	i purchased this over the ipod mini because it had several nice features extra 1g storage , wma support , replaceable battery , and especially that it wasn 't an apple product with their proprietary architecture
1	i didn 't have any major problems installing this software
0	it seemed as if we were emoting the pail everyday and it was in no way odorless
1	i 'd give it 4 5 stars if possible , but since 5 stars would be misleading , i give it 4 stars
1	i have had the ipod mini and it performs on the level with my sound card but the micro beats it outright
0	i also removed the springs in the plunge tubes to make it easier to raise
0	ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings , there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring
1	the soft start is a tremendous help for this type of operation
0	so i e mailed the online tech support with that simple question , and got a reply which was totally unresponsive ( it looked as though they didn 't actually read the e mail and just sent back a few boilerplate paragraphs )
1	nokia makes a great phone , that 's clear
1	2 ) the player user interface ( ui ) is intuitive to use , and allows easy navigation of a large or small collection
1	best phone i 've ever owned , period
1	nice palm sized unit , somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you 're not going to try jog with it or something
1	the price compared to the ipod is great
1	i had no problems following their installation instructions
0	however , my hard drive did fail , and i have not dropped it once
1	this product is way cooler than anything ive used before ( pencilings and maccabees and norton antivirus alone )
0	still has terrible software
1	speakerphone loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch
1	it has a cardboard slip cover with a nice layered box casing inside
1	bought the 30gb xtra a couple of weeks ago , and so far it has been excellent
0	i tried it again this morning and it said i didn 't have the required permissions and lacked proper administrator status
0	one caveat i have is that i understand the ipod does not save the photos in such a way that the quality of the image is preserved
0	if someone asked me flat out , i 'd say to go woth something else
0	also , the earbuds that came with it sound great but are uncomfortable ( although my wife didn 't have a problem ) , so i bought a pair of over the ear headphones
1	i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have n 't had any problems
1	once installed , however , some of the functions do work ok ( disk doctor , one button checkup , and win doctor )
1	navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer ( and vice verse ) was easy too
0	you can upgrade but then there 's a certain level of trouble involved
1	1 the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post processing flexibility
1	1 ) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its program and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n 't want to bother with the settings
1	it is easy to install and change the ordinary trash bags , easy to clean , and most important , easy to use one handed just insert folded dirty diaper and flip the handle
1	i love the features , the interface , the size ( the screen is a delight ) , the camera ( though i admit i 'm not much of a camera user so just a toy for me ) , the internet connectivity , the quality , etc
1	the new organizer software that ships with the nomad zen xtra could n 't be easier to use
0	if the plunging action is critical to your work , look elsewhere
1	although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department , it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do to be a wireless telephone
0	there is no way you can talk with customer care about this
1	after using it for about a month , i can state unequivocally that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck
0	the touch pad is over sensitive , and is adjustable to only slightly oversensitive
1	the 4g ipod costs the same as this 5g zen micro
1	the accessories that come with the player are great
1	the hitachi m12v is a dream to work with , smooth starts , adjustable speeds , micro adjustable depth , and plenty of power to spare
1	for a sleeker , smaller and more average mp3 player the nitrus is great but the ipod blows it out of the water the interface is great and the design is wonderful
1	it is small
0	durability not good first problem , if you haven 't seen the news recently , the ipods are being recalled for battery problems and not lasting the advertised 18 months
0	it seems like you need to park yourself right next to a radio tower for the micro to pull in a strong sound
1	also i like the position of all the controls and the fact that it doesn 't have any extra knobs or gizmo 's
1	it also lets you remove songs from the play order
1	in general it is easy to use and well laid out
0	i 've tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio , but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment
1	i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it
1	i almost always get a good strong signal , even in fairly remote areas here in the southwest
0	cons breaks easily
0	i can only hear the sound but no picture !
1	i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again
0	b ) the lens cover is surely loose , i already accidently finger printed the len a few times , and au lens ti gt and cause potential damage
0	the headphones which came with it are mediocre at best but what can you expect from a set of ear buds
0	for last one month my rebate status showing me that my rebate is approved and check is delivered but still i am waiting for check
1	with this mp3 player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod
1	i am impressed with this camera inside and out
0	the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to
0	i loved it until it broke , but less than a month is not an acceptable period of time for something to work
1	t mobile was a pretty good server
0	but this doesn 't make up for it 's innumerable other short comings , the biggest of which is the inability to download any updates due to problems with liveupdate
1	all in all , this is a great phone
0	this item broke just two weeks after i gave it to my kids for christmas
1	user interface the software is simple and straight forward
0	i would have liked to have given it 4 1 2 stars docking that 1 2 star only for the size
1	and it holds so much music and audio files
1	i 've had no problems at all so far and i 'm very happy
1	all you have to do is click one button on the router configuration window and the router automatically senses the devices and configures the network
0	i downloaded the new firmware which was supposed to take care of the problem , but it hasn 't worked
1	just want a wireless router for home or your very small business , you can just get a wrt54g from here and configure it
1	this is truly a clydesdale among the industry 3hp router workhorses
0	overall , a very disappointing product
1	the quality is significant and you 'll be very happy from saving time and the headache
1	overall , the micro is a solid device and i haven 't fell into a problem with it yet knocks on wood
0	dont rely on t mobile rebates
1	the mobile text messaging , chat , picture sharing etc other niceties , that you would enjoy
0	3 ) with mediasource being so easy , i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software
1	the other controls are all very easy to use
0	the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on , 60 percent of the time , it sis , shutting down , which means i have to turn off , and turn it on again , which is not to my likings
1	it did play a dvd r which was unplayable in my older philips machine
1	the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product
0	5 the zen does not have a stop button !
0	but my biggest gripe is still the extremely ugly design
1	i have not played with all the features yet , but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it
1	the service from the supplier was exceptional
1	looks ok very shiny chrome and mirrors
1	but it comes with a tank of a case and if you cut a piece out where the screen is you can always keep it in the case and still access everything
0	7 mediasource did not install on my personal notebook
1	otherwise , i am extremely please with the creative zen micro 5gb mp3 player
1	its sleek design , large memory capacity , compatibility with itunes , and ease of use makes this one of the best portable digital listening devices on the market
1	this camera takes amazing pictures and its size can not be beat
1	great design very sleek and touch wheel has still never been successfully copied ( virtual ones are the only competition ) and now the wheel clicks , taking away a lot of headaches from 3rd gen and very navigable in the menus
1	the bass treble the sound detail is aw some
0	i finally got a free support number for norton through my usp support staff , but waited an hour or more for a voice
0	the build quality shows why its so cheap small scratches on the base plate , something that you would n 't see on a sony and an overall plastic feel
1	the sound is amazing
1	it has great incredibility
1	2 take around 10 , 000 640x480 pictures
1	i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first class digital camera at a reasonable price there is no better camera out there period !
1	1 i achieved my basic objective my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more
1	3 ) joy stick for eazy navigation , 35mb memory card to store the pictures and stuff
1	just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has
1	overall i like the unit
1	the view finder shows crystal clear pictures that will look even better when you get them to the computer
0	the only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality longevity of the buttons on the thing
1	the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i 've ever had
0	the last problem i found with this camera was the macro function
0	5 ) this apex model 2600 will not work with my universal remote control
0	but , sometimes , if the champ is too full , the flip handle won 't function
0	the touch buttons do take a little getting used to and i don 't like how the scroll button is the same button used as an enter key , but you get used to it and it isn 't a big deal
0	i simply hate symantec i swear , if i could have physically ripped that software out of my computer with my bare , bleeding hands , i would have
0	so i took out the battery and put it back in again , only to find that it would not work
1	i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement
0	they will not respond to my emails ( promised turnaround time is 24 hours ) and the phone line is constantly busy
1	there are no spec ail bags to deal with or buy !
0	there is also no voice recording , something most if not all mp3 players have that the ipod doesn 't
1	i have had no problem what so ever with this product
0	i have read the installation instructions for both nis 2004 and navy 2004 prior to installation , but still ended up with the same result junk software
0	among its weak points is the mmc slot location and a bit vague design
1	4 looks great
1	reset the network , tried the connection , and it 's working like a charm
0	the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy
1	it 's really a shame , because otherwise , creative mp3 players are very good , and have the best sound quality of any players on the market
1	but the product is elf is great
1	1 record around 1 hour of video with phillips camcorder pro
0	the movie mode can only record a max of 30 seconds at 160x120 per clip and a max of 4 seconds at 640x480
0	you can disable some of the individual components , but don 't be fooled they 're still there and running
1	so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance , also anyone who wants a hard drive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing
0	typically , the problem is the headphone jack it was for me and many others
1	excellent range of metering options as well
0	i was willing to live with the larger size ( inconvenient on the road ) but the durability was a big zero
0	after a recent update , i can no longer open more then 1 browser window
0	this product sucks , the customer service from apex sucks
1	it is n 't big and offensive , though you would n 't know it by looking at the pics it takes
1	took me a few tries to get use to the navigation , but it 's a very user friendly player imo
1	the hard case they give with it must work well
0	this is not a router i would suggest for a novice user , my old dlink di52 !
1	this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used
1	i 've since gotten the linksys modem ( befcmu10 ) and stacked it with the wrt54g router and it works fantastic ! ! !
1	this is a great product !
0	sure it had all the features , but when i tried to shoot a girl 's basketball game it just wan 't up to the task
0	after installation , the very first time i booted up the creative mediasource organizer , intending to use its cd burning and ripping functions , it totally shorted out
0	some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to
0	the catch is it 's built like a piece of crap
1	please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod
1	i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra 40gb and it is fantastic !
0	who wants to go through the hassles of loading software onto a foreign computer just to move over some simple ( txt ) files ?
1	output through component connections looks very good , on my non hd tv
0	it has an equalizer , but the iriver h10 20gb has a lot more presets than the ipod
1	other than that it meets or surpasses all of my needs and surely won 't disappoint any already established nokia phone fans
0	the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out !
0	audio on video also lacking
0	but not good enough for me
1	it 's shorter , sleeker , more compact and fits comfortably in my small hand than the ipod my nokia cell phone towers over this bad boy !
0	i dont use the belt clip cz it fails to hold the player securely ( design problem )
0	the thing has survived plenty of falls with little or no damage , except the inevitable scratches
1	it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device
1	contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1 250 of a second with third party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon
1	this is a benefit for many reasons one being just for appearance , your pants wo n 't be bulging with this phone in your pocket
1	the touchpad is great once you get used to it , and i much prefer it to standard buttons or scroll wheels ( as on the dell dj for example )
0	the only complaint i have is that the 1 4 collet will not sufficiently hold any of my 1 4 bits
1	it 's easy to use , and makes transfering your cd collection to the player a cinch
0	no memory stick slots although a rare feature , it would be nice to have extra storage , not that it needs it built in lithium battery a huge hassle to bring this back draining the battery once you get it helps , but removable replaceable ones are a lot more convenient
0	this doesn 't affect standard mp3 files just subscription wma files
0	one more thing , the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible
0	after repeal cleaning and re cleaning , it still stuck after using it for a little while
1	transferring music is a breeze i don 't subscribe to music services , but as mentioned on other reviews , micro allows you to subscribe to services other than itunes
1	and so far , i 've been very pleased
1	i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size , speakerphone option , great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email
1	if you have to buy a camera on a bu get , this has got to be the one
1	what i like the most small and solid feel
0	while i was trying to play half life 2 it started popping up with alerts every twenty seconds ( literally ) , warning me my antivirus protection was off
1	the software has been installed on windows 95 , 98 , 2000 and xp and i haven 't had any problems with it
1	the pop up blocker and anti spam are bonuses
1	if you are looking for a user friendly diaper pail that actually does keep the odor contained , than the diaper champ is the one for you !
1	i upgraded from a very small 3 2 max camera to this camera with great results
1	it holds a lot of diapers , not to mention the odor !
1	you don 't need to cough up an extra couple bucks for a special edition to get black ! sound awesome ! batteries removable replaceable
0	controls are a bit awkward
1	the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain
0	will never purchase apex again
1	the latest of internet security has antispam function that is helpful because i has received a mountain of those these days
1	another great feature for me anyway is the ability to load wav sounds as ringers
1	creative was defiantly giving the ipod a run for their money with this device
1	also , very light and portable
0	i mean , they 're short !
1	but for what i do use it is perfect
1	i love my dark blue zen micro and would definitely recommend it
0	it can be frustrating and messy when you put that last diaper in before realizing the unit is full
1	and the phone has a very cool feature which allows you to send images via a normal pop3 smtp e mail account
1	the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night , but dim enough so it does n 't blind you when you stare too long
1	the color and light i captured with this camera on a 12 day trip to turkey ( gorgeous vividly colored ceramic tiles inside darkened mosques ) were far superior to anything i 've ever gotten with a traditional 35 mm film camera
1	the phone is sturdy
0	i 've had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose
1	while i 'm not too keen on their customer service ( none of the products i have from creative have given me issues ) , i can definitely recommend the zen micro for the simple fact that it does exactly what it is supposed to do and more without needing any of the extra hype except word of mouth
0	software the software that comes along with it is not very intuitive but once you are used to it , it does the job well
0	1 pictures wo n 't transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable
1	otherwise , this is a great alternative mp3 player for those of use who don 't want to worship the mighty all powerful apple
0	included creative software is pretty poor
1	one of my favorite features about the player is its ability to sync to windows media player
0	the downside being that the tito can only connect at 802 11b speeds and not 802 11g
0	my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons
1	i will also say that setting up the e mail account was very simple and straight forward , although you do need an external smut server to use
1	it powers up quickly , so you won 't miss that quick shot
0	1 creative mediasource software is ok to rip , catalog burn music if you are starting from scratch but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen ( 278 cds 3 , 400 tracks 12 5 gb of music all ripped at 128bps ) and guess what ?
0	but now that she is eating solids the odor is escaping out and we are constantly using freshener
1	also , i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and br mp3 cds ( my old apex ad 1200 had trouble with these )
0	i 've since replaced it with a pair of black sennheisers not only are the packaged earbuds pretty uncomfortable , but are too similar to ipod 's and can target ipod thieves here in nyc
0	main dial is not backlit
1	excellent sound i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox
1	the software could n 't be better and the mp3 player works like a dream , i could n 't give this anything but a 5 , i wish there was a 6
0	holy cow ! it really does scratch easily !
0	this product is absolutely not ready for release
0	essentially , the cd included with the package is , for the most part , worthless
1	it plays original dvds and cds and plays mp3s and jpegs
1	with my sennheiser 497 headphones , the volume is loud enough at 12 ( max is 20 )
0	i have had this player for 3 months and have been able to see a total of 6 dvd 's , after the frustration and aggravation of getting the player to do it 's job
0	i tried the cd setup program without any luck
1	i tell you now , after lot of shooting in many different situations , this camera is amazing
1	i have had no problems with the phone
0	neither message was answered ( they ask for 24 hours before replying i 've been waiting 27 days )
1	an extra gig of room , fm radio , voice recorder , pim applications with sync to outlook
0	it would only transfer 30 or so songs , and then come up with an error
1	both the on off switch ( soft start ) and the depth lock are within easy reach of the right hand
1	the sound from the player is ok
1	i can go pretty far away from my router and still connect wirelessly
0	only 1 problem , no accessories yet
1	everything shines of quality
1	it 's cheaper , holds more songs and is smaller
1	with all its complicated features , the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great
1	the battery holds a charge for a very long time ( maybe 15 or so hours of use ) so realistically there are no real range or endurance issues associated with ipod use
1	other than that , this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips
1	i first used the router in the free hand mode and liked it a lot
1	with 40gb of storage i have about 7 , 500 songs on the player ( everything music file i have is on there ) with room for about 2 , 500 more
1	it was easy enough to remove the front plate , and there was only one way the battery could be inserted
1	manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding
1	i 've dropped the device several times onto hard surfaces , and it still works flawlessly
0	i also put a bend in the wrench so i can remove and install bits from the top of the table
0	now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 !
1	it 's very solidly built , and has a nice dense feel to it
1	if you can get one with all the accessories and a cheap extended warranty , this is the player to get ! highly recommended
1	first , i have to say that i have never had the slightest problem with this camera or the software
0	ultimately you will learn just how bad nokia is , and why their recent loss of market share is so utterly deserved
0	less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows no disc
0	the internet functions of the phone wap and gprs will only work through t mobile 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network
1	audio is excellent
1	this phone is fantastic
0	so now it still plays everything , you just can 't see it !
1	overall , i highly recommend this phone
0	the function lever the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile
1	3 ) user replaceable battery
1	everything else about the camera is great
0	it has the odd side effect of the buttons only partially working ?
1	the camera has a wonderful set of features
1	slick looking design and improved interface
1	this camera is so light and tiny that i literally carry it everywhere with me , which is great considering i 'm an artist and like to capture interesting items for future painting
1	i do not count this as a negative , however , because it is not that much of a nuisance and at the price for what you get this router is way too good to pass up ! ! !
0	there was neither picture nor sound
0	however , in my mind , 299 is a lot to pay for a device that will only last 18 months
0	the ipod comes formatted for the mac , but within seconds of plugging it into a pc , is automatically reformatted for windows ( the hp version comes with windows formatting , and takes seconds to change to mac ) although the ipod can be changed from one format to another , you will lose all of your music and data when doing so
1	you can also slow a song down speed it up , which is cool too
1	the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone , and what a great phone it is
1	the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly
1	i 've had this camera just over 2 years and it takes pretty good pictures
0	now i know why they are pieces of junk
0	the ms scandisk would appear due to manual shutdown and would only scan to the 2nd bar , over and over ( up to 1 hr , i then shut it down and used go back )
0	the eax sound enhancement feature did n 't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq
1	in all fairness , customer reps are very nice , and they ( most of them ) try hard to answer your questions
1	still , i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features !
1	the battery is also convenient , but could have been better , such as the zen touch 's battery ( but at least this one is removable )
1	10 ) multiple play modes tracks in order of album , shuffle , etc , is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter
1	sound quality excellent , everything you would expect from this company
0	the internet connection would go down every 5 mins when i used it with a p2p program called bit spirit
0	however , it has failed to deliver on quality
1	it is no more heavy than any other powerful router and not as bad as some porter cable models i tried
1	it 's great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen
1	the service from t mobile is very good too
1	this player is absolutely phenomenal , i haven 't had any problems , and if you 're worried you will have problems , i suggest buying it at a retail store that has a good return policy but anyways i find the touch pad very easy to use , and i 'm surprised so many people have had problems
1	it 's a bit pricey to call home from other countries but the instant messaging to and from covered countries in europe are quite reasonable
1	it is heavy enough to make it stable , but not too heavy to preclude hand use
1	by the way , it looks nice also
0	you also need to go in and manually remove many symantec files from the registry
0	3 4 way through the first disk we played on it ( naturally on 31 days after purchase ) the dvd player froze
1	the music is easy to get to ( all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with the zen
1	the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it ( jpeg , kodak pic 's and dvd r ) i have read other reviews and some good and so om not so good , but my feeling at this time is two thumbs up !
0	one beef is the scroll , it does n 't work as well as i 'd like
0	the product also leaves a faint smell in the room
0	i was having intermittent problems with it losing connection
0	the general button placement is not very user friendly
1	removable battery
1	i have n 't messed with the firmware at all , the player worked perfect for me right out of the box
1	the battery on mine lasts 2 days if i don 't play games that much , and it only takes 90 mins to charge from flat
0	so , don 't buy this or upgrade
1	overall , it 'll make my move that much easier knowing i don 't have to worry about connectivity
1	pros the design is very nice , and the colors are too
1	this camera is perfect for the person who wants a compact camera that produces excellent photos in just about any situation
0	although , i thought it could 've been designed a bit better
1	neat feature for self timer allows you to record two different warnings
0	it had a heavier and more sturdy casing
1	i 'm really happy with this purchase
1	this player is fantastic in terms of audio quality , ease of use , and features
1	the sound quality is excellent ( and i 'm fussy with that stuff ) , the unit looks cool , screen is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod ( besides the price , but everyone knows that )
1	i 've had almost no problems with the firmware ( ie , lock ups , shut downs etc ) , but i have kept the player up to date
1	the nokia 6600 is a great phone , good games , good camera
1	i love the features on the ipod and the many things you can do with it
1	i like to take pictures when i go out at night and perhaps some people would complain that noise levels are high at higher iso 's but i don 't really care that much , i think it gives the pictures a certain real life quality
0	cranking the master volume level up past the mark of the bar only leads to distortion and compromised sound quality
1	it holds plenty of songs
0	the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected
1	the ease of use of the ipod is a major attribute
1	the color screen makes this free after rebates phone shine bright , and commands are very responsive
0	since i received the phone , i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised t zones would work in 24 hours
1	the menus are very easy to navigate
0	i try navigating using the player 's built in menu , and it still would n 't work !
1	the battery life is ok , but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on
1	the setup software did everything
0	when you dial a number , you 'll need to check the screen to see that the number entered is correct
1	i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far
0	navigation could be better , but there is n 't really anything the zen xtra can 't do once you 've gotten comfortable with it
1	when i turned the phone on , the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is
0	to eliminate any smells we simple stuck a stick up room deodorizer inside the lid
0	there were many times when i clicked the automatic shutter and nothing happens
1	very good balance in the hands and lighter than most 3 1 4 hp models
0	2 ) the remote works , but then it does not work , and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong
1	this is my fourth linksys product and , aside from the rough start , i 'm very satisfied with this router
0	in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class
0	because steve jobs is a twisted individual and he made sure that he ruined this device by giving it an unrepeatable 18 month battery
0	one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia , so standard headphones will not work
0	i tried to call norton , and the only numbers they list on their sites are either for non tech customer service ( tried this one and hung up after 75 minute of muzak ) or they have a 30 tech support number
1	solid , high quality construction
0	the dvd player does not work properly
1	the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options
1	the hitachi has plenty of power , runs smooth , and cuts effortlessly through maple ( with freud bits ! )
0	however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times
1	the great and versatile ipod
1	the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution
1	it 's a very intuitive program
1	the phone is very light weight
1	it is a bit difficult to get the unit open ( the advice to take it slowly is sound ) , but now that our son is walking and exploring , i consider this a positive attribute !
1	it 's very quiet for a universal motor driven tool , and the height adjustment stick and variable speed control are great
1	why bother when it works perfectly with media player 10 ?
1	this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it
0	im at full capacity ! ! ! ! i called syman tic and they said they don 't know why but i should get tech 's support at 35 hr to help ! ! i did call them and was on hold for 55 minutes until i hung up !
1	the prints are beautiful !
0	i was up all night trying to make the stupid thing work , to no avail
1	sound quality the ipod 's sound quality is pretty good
0	i had never liked the idea of the diaper genie because of the refills
1	the 6600 was the best phone i could find with these options that i could get with t mobile
0	in fact , it caused my system to hang more times than not , so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource 100
1	the sound quality is very good
1	as i said , i don 't regret the purchase at all
0	i haven 't seen any problems yet , but if you don 't like to tinker a bit , this player can be a little challenging to set up
1	the ipod is a very nice product , which given reasonable care , should give a lot of service
0	it took me three days , to the tune of neil young 's song piece of cr ! , to get this to work with the satellite hookup i was hired to connect this wireless network up to
0	the front cover ( which you remove to take out the battery ) feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid
0	the screen may be a little smaller , but it is very readable and does n 't come in the overused blue
1	bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense filters choices
1	i was looking for a phone which synced with mac osx using bluetooth , had decent battery life , could check email , had good reception , nice screen size and was durable ( i break often break small gadgets )
1	transferring files couldn 't be easier thanks to the included software bundle
0	first , the sound quality is okay , but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the eax can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes
0	it is the 'first generation ' of the player , and while i still agree that it is a great alternative to the ipod , i think there are many others that would be a much better value for your buck
1	it plays alternate video formats ( cads , svcds , cods ) very well
0	however , i suspect that many people are having a bad experience do not purchase this product
0	this one is particularly bothersome allegedly one can use the zen micro as a portable drive to store and transport data from one computer to another
1	the startup time , quality of pictures and videos is outstanding
1	if you use linux and want gr ps and or want to use a handsfree bluetooth device , and want a decent camera this is the phone for you
1	overall build quality , good macros results , impressive video quality , good pictures with flash ( good colours , sharp results ) , excellent auto white balance
0	i tried to play the song three times , with no success
1	i purchased this camera before it went on sale , and while i wouldn 't have minded keeping the extra , it was definitely worth it
1	the earbuds that come with it are n 't that bad
0	2 ) the body construction buttons , casing , etc , are too plastic
1	getting files onto it is quick and painless
1	wow was that disappointing and we didn 't even have it 6 months before it broke
1	it 's a great looking , easy to use device but it 's the sound quality which is truly amazing far better than my sony mini disc player
1	20 gb or 40 gb ? the pros of the 40 gb comes with a dock station and double storage space ( 10 , 000 songs )
1	have had the nokia 6600 for a year now and am generally very happy with it and with t mobile
0	now this router is not the cheapest on the market
0	the dynamic playlists ( now playing , i be live creative calls it ) feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate
0	i replaced it with a router raiser and it works much better
1	the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n 't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk
1	your choice of ten colors in a beatiful package
1	the zen offered a great alternative
0	norton online support does not even acknowledge this problem nor does the computer company that preloaded it on our new computer
0	i try navigating to a chapter past 34 via the menu and it would n 't do it !
0	the lcd screen is too small since there are so many cameras that have larger ones
1	the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation a slightly audible click if i am not listening for the progress from one track to the next i do n 't even notice the click
0	however , the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality
1	thank you apple ! you make fabulous products
1	their products have been great and have saved my bacon on numerous occasions
1	we just buy the smaller bags that come like 250 to a roll and are scented and they are like 6 00 and they work great
0	no in box accessories an arm strap , belt strap , case , or anything would be nice , but nope moveable parts this makes me almost want to keep my 3rd gen over a 4th with moveable parts , its easy to damage an ipod at a gym , so this is for more casual listeners note the ipod mini doesn 't have moveable parts and is made of titanium
0	even when i set it to low , it 's still very hard for me to adjust the player to where and what i want it to do
1	pi ii 1ghz 512mb rd ram windows xp pro 80gb hd i was able to uninstall nis 2003 and install nis 2004 with no trouble
1	works great ! ! ! !
0	after telling the rep and his tech supervisor the problem the only answer was to uninstall the program ( which i had already done )
1	purchased this router a few months back , no problems whatsoever
1	although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon
1	the nomad is not ugly , it is not that big , it comfortably fits in my pocket , or heavy , and the controls are not hard to get used to
1	3 play java games on it
1	i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes no crashes or problems
1	it 's easy enough to pop it open to see what song you 're listening to
0	the phone does not have an mp3 player , fm radio , 200k color screen , megapixel camera , quad band , pda , photo editor
1	i particularly like the txt file which records all the control information for all the pictures you take
1	creative has been making computer sound equipment for decades and with the zen micro it finally has something with enough quality and , yes , charm to win a nice size of the digital player pie
0	the vibration is not top
0	after less than 24 hours it turned out to be a huge disappointment , for myself and for my parents , for whom it was a gift
1	the manual mode is feature rich and i can 't wait to get the hang of it
1	the menus are easy to scroll through they are laid out naturally , and make sense
1	secondly , all info can be sent to a computer and w o the hassle of usb wires
0	the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select , you have to push straight in or it sticks
1	the package also comes with a usb cable , an ac adapter , a pair of headphones ( they 're okay until you get a better pair ) , a stand , and a microfiber pouch to carry your zen touch in
1	the songs recorded with fm are as good as the original signal
0	( on here of course ) also , a couple dvd 's would n 't play and they were new ones !
1	the touch buttons are textured so that your finger sdon 't slip which was very thoughtful
0	it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation
0	3 months of use and it no longer recognizes anything
1	also love waking up to music with attached speakers
0	i built my own router table with a tilt up top made a hand crank to replace the height adjustment knob these two things make it easy to change out raise or lower the bits
1	the sound quality is also nice after i hooked up my sony headphones instead of those factory earbuds it comes with
1	what impressed me most was the sound
1	the fit and finish of the product is first rate
0	the only con i can think of is the lack of a mega pixel camera
1	i 'm not one who uses web browsing , so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs
1	this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made
1	the edge guide is top quality , easy to install and accurate
1	seems to read most dvds fine , and reads quietly ( i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise )
0	finally , i reiterate my thumbs down rating for t mobile as a carrier
1	nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games , graphics and ringtones from www crazy cellphone com
0	the cover that came with it did n 't fit very well
0	both of them keep disconnecting on me and interruptions are 3 or 4 times per day at best
1	overall this is a slightly better than average phone
0	my file log was not responding and the program was not blocking any cookies or unauthorized sites
0	same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex nothing
1	both the antivirus and firewall are integrated into one piece of software and they update together
1	the size of the camera is perfect
1	i was using the cheaper pail and it worked ok until the opening device fell apart
1	i got a 1gb mmc upgrade for this phone and now i can
1	5 ) the cheap , user replaceable battery ( 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs 100 to replace
1	the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them
0	my only significant complaint is sound quality
1	for the most part this is a good dvd player
1	takes excellent photos
0	the sliding latch is does not stay in place
1	the controls on the player are very simple , no need for a manual
1	it 's good
1	7 picture quality is excellent
0	also , diapers and wipes get stuck in the grove below the piston
1	t simply the best player on the market for a really low price , so why look anywhere else ?
1	i absolutely love it
1	i took it to my father 's house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him
0	the next problem was that it didn 't recognize all the installed components , so it would not update them , most notably and importantly , virus definitions
1	the 6600 has more amenities than most world phone , camera ( vga zoom night mode timer ) , video ( w audio zoom ) , speaker ( good sound ) , bluetooth , infrared , modem for computers , electronic wallet , internet access , calendar , calculator , converter and more
0	i don 't know , maybe i got a defective one but first , the player would not shut off , next , the player would not come on i had to send it away to get repaired
0	it 's kinda heavy , kinda like having a walkman
1	the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there
1	i bought this camera two days ago , and i 'm very pleased to say that it has been worth the money
0	i did have to cut off the ears that hold the template guide in place so i could get those big panel raising bits in it
1	in a week of use i 've never had to reboot the router
1	after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature loaded , high performance , travel size camera , i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality 4 mega pixel
1	well , this apex dvd player turned out great !
0	i left the camera in my car in maine ( not a very hot place ) and the lcd screen cracked !
1	sound quality is great , fm tuner is fine , as is the recorder
0	have tried to contact apex via e mail ( customerservice apexdigital com ) , but the e mail address is not valid
1	nice little phone light compact
1	this is my first digital camera and i could n 't be happier
0	the best thing to do with this version , is to leave it on the store shelf it doesn 't work , and will cost you an enormous amount of your time , not to mention your hard earned dollars
1	the device looks very cool , i think ( exactly as the photos promise ) , it 's comfortable and lightweight in my jacket pocket , and the interface and controls are easy enough to navigate after a bit of practice
1	and also , since it is teri band and since it uses sim card , you can just use it in europe and many other parts of the world , wherever gsm exists
0	the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this
1	i did not have any of the installation problems that people highlighted here
1	all in all though i 'm very happy with my new mp3 player
1	all in all i am pleased with the router
0	there is no photo viewing option , however , there is a 20 gb photo ipod , but it costs 20 more
1	nokia and t mobile really teamed up well on this baby
1	with eax on , you can modify your sound , with 4 different presets , which is pretty good , you can get different variations with it
1	works great , no odor , and uses regular bags
1	it 's fast , feels great in your hand and looks great too
1	for the money apex machines have good features
0	2 ) music organization is based on id3 ( by genre , artist , album , etc ) and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id3 information
1	i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer
0	third , the poor design continues with the case
1	8 battery life is excellent
1	this is overall the best point and shoot camera i 've used
1	pros large hard drive for the 20gb and 40gb are both affordable
1	the software comes with plenty of defaults genres
1	the range is terrific , i am using this for my home and i was transferring at 50 mbs from my backyard
1	the setup and transfer process was cake for me
1	this is a wonderful camera
1	i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had
1	however after playing with it for three weeks now , i 'm convinced , the zen micro is superior
1	the canon computer software used to download , sort , upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use
1	proven canon built quality and lens
1	the speed is the same as dali up , where i live we do not have wifi everywhere so this is my version of it until we catch up
0	all in all , not very good
1	i do not need to repeat what 's great about this phone
1	upside this one , like most nokias , receives a consistently strong signal ( i 've tried some samsung and sony ericsson models which were very weak on the reception front )
1	the in program id3 tag editing is a strong point , as well
1	this is really a nice diaper pail
1	just easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter id tags and sort your music according to your liking , by artist , song title , genre , etc
1	and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play
1	it 's overkill for simple snapshots , unless you 've got way too much money to blow
0	radio quality weak reception
1	6 play game boy color games on it with go boy
0	i say adequate because it was enough to get wireless working , but nowhere near enough instruction to do the proper configuration job that i could have done if so !
0	my first router is a safety hazard if you do not pay attention and are not very careful
0	it feels like i 'm back to the days of 56k dial up internet service , even though i 'm running a dell 2ghz pentium 4 with 256mb memory and have had excellent broadband service for the past year
0	the menu pops up after 3 seconds the picture takes a while to load from its slow card memory
1	while i like the performance of the phone in every regard , i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it
1	i have about 6 gb used on my ipod so far ( well over 1000 songs ) , and as far as i can tell , all of them play at near cd quality
1	it was also the most appealing
0	with the plunge lift all my bit changing has been done above the table , although i still have to reach below the table to operate the spindle lock ( and , of course , the speed and on off controls )
0	what a junk
1	the file ripping transfering software that comes with the player is easy to use
1	the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen
1	i don 't know why cnet says there is a problem with focus , i have all my pictures sharp and high quality
0	we resorted to using small plastic bags to store the dirty diapers and dumping them in a trash can and using the diaper champ for wet diapers only
1	the diaper champ is the best we found !
0	it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want
0	this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands
1	the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well re cored mp3s
0	and the body construction in general has quite a bit of plastic , a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330
0	as of october , 2004 , these products are not working and i 'm ready to demand a refund from symantec
1	but overall this is a good camera with a ' really good ' picture clarity an exceptional close up shooting capability
0	the karma is only 5 more , it 's small , had a 20 gig drive and supports more formats including gog
1	i am a big fan of itunes , simply because it is terribly fast and convenient if you are buying the songs from the itunes site
1	take quick pictures with excelent resolution
0	even the shorter battery life , though , has not impaired my positive experience with the zen micro in any way
1	i have owned some kind of creative audio product since 1993 and have never had to call tech support
1	the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to
1	diaper champ is by far the best diaper pail !
1	this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well
1	pick your favorite color and buy it
1	2 ) nice features , like web browser , camera , video recorder , speaker phone ( very usefully ) , clear voice reception
1	actually , the creative zen micro solves all that
1	the ones i 've kept ( porter cables , dew alts , bosch , and this hitachi ) have proven their worth over the years , however , when i need a real workhorse , i grab this router
0	well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise
1	all in all it hasn 't been a bad product
1	it uses the extend able mmc memory , it is perfect for storing videos , pictures and mp3s
0	the only thing i don 't like is the small size ( 8 meg ) memory card that comes with it
1	great camera , great investment !
1	i have a couple hundred contacts and the menu loads within a few seconds , no big deal
0	( it had locked up multiple times previously , but always managed to work after wards ) this time , the touch screen wouldn 't respond to me and none of the buttons worked
1	it 's low profile , space saving design looks nice
1	both are very easy to learn use , and intuitive enough for even a novice
1	i use it for ripping cds , which it does a pretty good job of
1	my op ion is concentrate on what you need now , this product has excellent range , holds a teddy connection , ha sent even drooped one and i have it for more than a month now
1	6 ) excellent battery life 14 hours beats ipod 's
1	i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song playlist etc fast enough
1	still , at least from my perspective , a great camera for the money , and i 'm a happy camper !
0	i have found too many bugs in norton internet security professional to recommend it to any one without extreme patience and experience
1	i have stored around 60 cd 's ( at 160kbps ) on this and have barely touched the available memory
1	there 's even an equalizer ( under settings ) that allows you to adjust the sound for acoustic , bass booster , bass reducer , classical , dance , deep , and electronic
1	it holds quite a few diapers , and pops them in quickly and easily
0	i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because , as other reviewers have pointed out , the construction is pretty flimsy
0	2 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations
1	price !
1	as for itunes , i don 't find it to be as good as the windows media player as a computer mp3 player , but it is good enough
1	exposure compensation in 1 3 stop increments ( i leave it set on 1 3 stop to brighten up the default exposure , which goes a bit dark for my taste )
1	navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch
1	it works well with my vip adapter , which is also a linksys
0	the battery power discharges rapidly especially on using the web browser
1	autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all
1	the use of 65536 ( 16bit ) colors ensures you get your share of animations and icons on your phone
1	we were able to obtain a norton corporate edition of antivirus only ( no firewall or utilities ) and so far it 's great
0	after scouring the various boards i find this is an arbitrary and pervasive problem
1	i could make phone calls from locations i previously could not ( like my apartment )
0	because the engineers at creative screwed up the design of the headphone jack
1	you can turn this phone into a gaming machine , a camcorder or a digital camera , an mp3 player , a movie viewer , a voice recorder , a personal secretary , a gaps map browser , a book , a multifunction remote controller , practically everything that you can do with the computer , plus it is a phone ( ! ! ) and also you can carry it in your pocket )
0	headphones suck , i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature
1	the battery is replaceable ( a real plus ) and there is a leather case ( another real plus )
1	norton pops up a window about the intrusions and gives me as much detail as possible about where the intrusion is coming from
1	the latter will provide better coverage in more remote areas of the states but still operates in many countries , excluding new zealand and australia
0	nothing spectacular is done by internet security or by antivirus software
1	i got it working fast enough
1	the screen is bright , easy to see in the daylight , with nice colors
1	the camera is very easy to use , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group
1	over all a fantastic very compact camera , which made us experience photography on a totally new level !
1	at works as well as can be expected for products in this space and the company backs it up with good support
1	the interface has a sassier flair and the blue lit trimming is an added bonus
1	i can keep one hand on my baby and dump the diaper at the same time , it is that simple
1	i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks , and the ease of use is wonderful
1	what an upgrade ! ! !
1	the good news is that the creative support is very responsive and after some emails and postal exchanges , i had a new zen
1	most of the other players i checked dont have user serviceable battery
1	the blue backlit lcd looks really neat and is easy to read
1	sound excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice ( check cons ) it also doubles as a radio , which is a nice feature when you are bored
1	the camera is as easy to use as a point and shoot , and with instant review on the lcd screen , you can retake any flubbed shots on the spot
0	also , i can 't understand why the software does not ignore the when it lists the cds in alphabetical order
1	with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority ( for high speed subjects ) , aperture priority ( for focal length ) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality
1	i recently bought the linksys wrt54g router and have been very happy with the router itself
1	reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive
0	it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot
0	still , that 's enough time that i 'm still satisfied , if a bit grouchy with creative 's over hyped promises
1	size extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you
1	i purchased this phone for just 50 and there is no end to what i can do with it
0	after some research on the net , i discovered that there is indeed a flaw with the current wrt54g design ( wrt54g , version 3 , which amazon currently sells )
1	it is quiet and has plenty of power
1	all in all , this is another excellent creative product
1	travel with it without knowing you have it in your pocket
1	flawless
0	we found that when you put a dirty diaper into the top loader , there was a tendency to get streaks which would then get on the plunger which would then have to get cleaned each time it was used
0	this fixes some glitches such as the player freezing
0	the auto color balance is often fooled by dense clouds
1	the player is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium
0	after about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd 's are dirty
1	their customer service agents are always prompt and polite and my service is terrific
1	there is also a small covering for the lens , so you need not worry that the lens will get scratched
1	after considering my needs further and researching the marketplace , i decided on the s100
1	it has plenty of power
0	yeah this program protects your computer all right by locking you off the internet
1	i just upgraded to the linksys wrt54g wireless g router last month and i am very happy with the quality of the product
1	apple has definately fulfilled its reputation in making quality equipment , and surprisingly wasn 't as expensive as its reputation normally holds
1	while it didn 't have all the features i would have liked , it was better than anything else i could find at the time
0	2 ) no games it has a cool screen why not use it
1	it 's a highly rated , kick ass firewall program that 's bundled with the venerable norton antivirus , plus extras ( like norton antispam norton parental control ) that make this security suite a must have for people who have broadband internet access
1	in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click , the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results
1	this isn 't the most rugged phone ever but then your not gonna play airplane with this , are you
0	cons difficult to open to change bag twice my bags caught on a sharp edge inside and snagged as i was pulling out leaving dirty diapers all over the floor
0	the software , mediasource , can not work on my pc ( laptop , intel p4 2 0 , xp os )
0	the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra 30 gb is the software
0	if you 've been listening to cd 's in your car for awhile , dealing with the drop off in sound quality may take some getting used to
1	fm transmitter ( belkin has a good one ) to use zen with your car stereo fm tuner latest find connected this baby to my 3800 audiophile audio system and it produced clean sound compared to ipod
1	get it , it 's woth every penny ! !
1	great sound good interface replaceable , powerful battery good software wake up , sleep timers multiple play modes
0	4 my idea was that it was an all in one , and that theory once again proves wrong , this phone ex cells at nothing , less than average in everything , if you seriously need any of the other than phone functionalists , you 'll be disappointed if you have lots of money and bought it for the love of gadgets then fine but don 't expect to get much done
1	the stand that comes with it is very useful to prop it up on the desk
0	seems it is always difficult to press to make a selection
1	it 's easy
1	the macro mode is exceptional , the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject
0	linksys is more costlier than others and is a home consumer division of disco
0	the only disappointment so far has been battery life
0	2 ) having unfilled id3 tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called unknown
0	i 'm going to try to get a refund but considering all the hoops i jumped through ( emails , downloads , reboots , a purge and another download , plus reading through the help menu ) a refund should be twice as frustrating
1	finding all the albums , songs etc is much easier than you would think it would be even if you have 20 gig ( well 18 gig ) worth of music
1	features click wheel to navigate ability to work with windows or mac optional back lighting ( you can have it on all the time , or have it shut off to save battery power after 5 , 10 , or 20 seconds ) ability to download pda info automatic or manual download from itunes when ipod is plugged into your computer
1	sound i 'm no audiophile but i was amazed by the clarity the player had , it was much better than the sound card on my computer and louder too
0	i had a question about the pros and cons of turning off the norton firewall vs the windows firewall , and waited 45 minutes to speak with a tech support representative because i did not have a customer priority id number
1	the rate plans are also very good , at least for me
1	this way i never have to be ripped off by the carrier for stupid ringtones , i can get whatever i want
0	not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days , it just would not recognize anything i pop in it
1	plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad
1	i just got an older 866 mhz system with 512 pc 133 ram and it also runs fine on that
1	for the zen creative focused on packaging which looked well thought out , well presented and easy to open and put back together
0	the creative mediasource software that comes with the zen micro is cluttered , and excludes my favorite feature in itunes , the ability to automatically copy everything you import into a certain folder
1	you can use the ob ex file transfer service with bluetooth from linux ( kde bluetooth provides a nice integration into conqueror for this ) for sending files to the phone
0	it is not reliable
1	the speakerphone , the radio , all features work perfectly
1	all in all , this product is definitely one i would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price
1	after some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative , and i have not been disappointed
0	the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warranty period is to expire
1	the pictures are tack sharp , colors are vivid , and at 7 mega pixels the quality is plenty high to manipulate and crop images to your hearts desire
0	when i hooked it up it only produced sound a cd played fine , but with a dvd i only got the audio no picture !
1	so for the money it costs for one of those top of the line models i 've got a good router a nice table to put it in i like that
0	fm receiver it has none
1	fits comfortably in my inside jacket pocket or in my pants pocket
1	with the right firmware , drag and drop to and from the player like any other jump drive
1	it works better and has more useful features than nis 2003
1	audio is mono and fairly acceptable , quiet also with little distortions
1	the scene mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a regular setting
1	3 it is very compact but the controls are so well designed that they 're still easy to use
1	nothing has broken on it , and it plays all the dvds i have
1	i have especially enjoyed the 640x480 mode , while not a replacement for a dedicated video camera , its quality easily surpasses that of my old hi 8 camera and is perfect for quick clips of things that still images just dont describe ( max 8 mins at 640 30fps on a one gig card )
0	the interface took a little getting used to
1	i like it 's shape and it 's keypad and joystick
0	it 's not the heaviest around ( i think porter cable has that distinction ) , but i found its combination of weight and power really too much to allow precise handheld operation
1	battery life is very good , i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so
1	the camera is solid , performs well , takes good pictures , and the battery lasts pretty long if you disable the lcd viewfinder
0	tech support from apex is literally nonexistent
1	this camera also has a great feel and weight to it
0	the dvd player just would 't recognize them
1	overall i 'm incredibly impressed with my new zen touch
1	recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available
1	so , i was one who was ready to give it 5 stars with no complaints at all
0	it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen , and if the button did n 't cover up the ac jack
0	after consulting with creative 's customer support , they determined that the hard drive was broken and the only recourse was to send it in for repair , which would cost me 40 , since it 's past the 90 day warranty ( pretty short warranty )
1	this is a fantastic tool to use
1	the battery recharges raul fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice
1	try before you buy if at all possible although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod , the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface
1	this phone is highly recommended otherwise
0	they claim to respond in a 24 hour period yet it 's been 2 weeks without a reply
0	the touch sarene navigation will take a little getting used to , but once you do , and while the zen is still alive , it 's a great alternative to the marching in lock step with the click wheel commies
0	after we discovered the problems , we tried to contact apex ( flor 3 months ) , but we never got in touch with them the customer support telephone number is always busy , and they do not answer their web customer support
0	do not buy any home version of norton anything
1	the fact that you can assign ringtones to people and or groups is really cool
1	am so glad i bought this camera
0	however , it needs to be quite quiet for it to work at all dosn 't work at all in the car , for example
1	holds the odor in nicely !
0	this is due to the unusually slow autofocus system
1	by focusing exclusively on quality rather than excessive marketing , they have introduced a player that can look the ipod straight in the eye and not flinch
1	the power is incredible , it cut through md and plywood like butter
1	this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in
0	i 'd give it 5 stars if the automatic modes were better and if there were true manual focus and exposure modes
0	granted , i have only used this dvd player for about 2 hours setting it up for my mom for christmas , but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player
1	there are lots of interesting features included such as eax , and customization
1	don 't worry this player rocks
0	the sound is not loud enough when i play back the video clips on the camera
1	the reception and sound quality are top notch
1	to set up the box , wap , and ether nest bridge , with the encryption on was less then 30 mins
1	there are instructions to encrypt your personal wireless network so no one else can end up hogging stealing your bandwidth
1	the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out ( as all lithium batteries do ) , you will be able to buy another easily
0	the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products , which is very dumb
0	i 've sent 10 e mails to their customer service department requesting an ra with no response
0	one of the dvd 's i received as a christmas present kept freezing
1	it looks great and is loaded with features
1	there is no odor and it is very easy to use
1	pertaining to the speed issue i got 54mps while i was in the same room
0	on occasion i 'm not able to connect to the phone with isync via bluetooth but i found that rebooting the phone seems to solve this problem
0	i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again
0	they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same sounding name ( and they are long )
0	i especially like the more commonly used buttons , such as play , pause , and stop , to be larger and conveniently placed
1	i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time
1	very cool features great camera with zoom cool quality pictures great ringtones bluetooth feature is great
1	the volume range is great , so you can blast it if you want
0	i downloaded this set from norton , and within minutes my internet connection failed and my pc was almost dead due to registry problems from the download
1	tough as nails
1	i got this phone yesterday and didn 't find any problems with it yet
0	the headphones are not very comfortable , but most people have a certain style they like so just go buy new ones or keep the ones you have
0	the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot
0	i forgot , the case does n 't fit
1	for the price it is a well spent investment !
1	the m12v has been great
1	feature for feature , i find it a very sweet little player equipped with a higher end headphone system , between this and th larger zen hardly use my home stereo system anymore
1	the zen lives up to the audio quality i love and expect
1	1 ) price gb of storage
1	if you 're looking for a 3hp plunge router , the hitachi m12v is your best bet to stretch your equipment budget
0	i took it out one day and the lcd was not working
1	norton 's memory usage on systems with 512 mb is very low
1	simply , the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point
1	creating and modifying playlists is easy and clean
0	this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues
1	i compared this to a lot of other cameras , believe me , it 's value for money
1	despite this minor disappointment , i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography
1	it will not replace your high end 35mm slr but it 's a great toy to keep near you at all times for snapshots
1	i like some local stations , stern , and npr , and so the radio seemed like a great option
1	start up is so quick
0	but the major problem i had was with the software
0	the menu options appear one at a time , taking up the whole screen , and one has to scroll down one by one , or have memorized where they are in the menu order , to select them by using the number keypad
1	this was possible due to the variable speed settings for any sized bit
0	battery life is not long enough if and only if you take a lot of video clips and play it back on the camera a lot of times the camera battery gets a little bit warm too when you use it for a long time but it 's normal
1	and the video quality is amazing
1	great phone , i 'd buy another
0	it wo n 't play 80 of my movies , which are all store bough ten
1	but , dollar for dollar , this dvd player is probably the best out there
1	i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it
1	remember , this phone uses an operating system symbian and it 's feature rich w 65k colors
0	my friend has an ipod , and although the sound quality probably won 't meet most audiophile standards , the product itself is better than anything creative has made
1	before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp3 players but finally decided on this one , and now that i have it i could n 't be happier and i 'm convinced it 's the best one out there
0	unfortunately it can 't play all of the dvd
0	you can see the lens barrel in the view finder
1	it is currently permanently mounted ( 3 years now ) in my router table and will most likely stay there until its shot
1	no smell , easy to use with one hand free , and best of all it uses regular tall kitchen garbage bags so you don 't get suckered in to using only the bags made for the pail that are impossible to find !
0	maybe this new design is more durable than the last , but i kind of doubt it
1	it 's being used daily and i have had none of the problems reported by other reviewers ( headphone jack , player locking up , etc )
1	range of functions as indicated above it has something for everyone point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography
1	you do not have to waste money or time trying to purchase special bags for the champ
0	i did see the review here and other places about a cracked lcd screen
0	symantec should give us all a refund and apology !
0	( i never know when the champ is full as there is no way too tell even though not particularly aesthetic , how about making the champ clear and see through ? ) so , i lift the lid and find a wad of diaper , which i must remove , usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full
1	this is an excellent router for the money
0	there isn 't much features on the ipod at all , except games
1	for a specific location , i still think its a great phone
1	finding a particular song ( s ) or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy
1	it gives you the most bang for your buck , period
1	it is mindless to operate
0	the biggest problem is the installation
1	amazon is awesome !
1	all in all this is a 5 star piece of equipment
0	it seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that 's inserted maybe 10 seconds of wait
0	the environmental audio , however , is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it ( i encode my songs at 192 256 kbps without variable bit rates )
1	feels solid in hand
1	the player looks great , feels great , and sounds great
1	this camera is closest to perfect than any other diagram that is 4 5 megapixel
0	i 'm giving it 4 stars because the setup process was so miserable
0	to address two previous somewhat negative reviews ( 1 ) yes , the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder however , the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder
0	just too numerous to list fm radio , which has weak reception , but at least it there , and a microphone , to name just two
1	playlists can be made on the fly , without aid of a computer , and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your ' now playing ' selections or playlists
0	the only main drawback is the fact that the voice dialing system is kinda picky
0	also much less stinky
1	another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world
1	but since it 's so small , it isn 't a big deal to bring it with me
1	while i am not happy that a solid state device died after such a short period of time , my quick review of this product space did not yield any other brands that seem much better than linksys
0	unlike my 3 other mp3 players , this thing will only work properly if you have id3 tags on all of your tracks
1	all in all , creative has definitely come up with a winner in terms of product design and features , and i look forward to the nomad zen line of products seizing more market share as people begin to realize that quality is a better determinant of experience than quantity and hype
1	i can 't write enough positive things about this great little camera !
0	buttons size is ok for me , my wife , but not my granny
1	basic usage is easy , but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have n 't used
1	all in all , i believe this is arguably the best non slr digital camera on the market
1	i like the size and shape
0	while the software may not be as easy as i tunes , it is not difficult to use by any stretch
1	i am getting better speeds on all my web programs
1	i 've taken about hundred shot with the canon , in varying lighting situations , all in auto mode , and not one blurry picture ! ! !
1	sound this is where i love zen the most
0	the volume level of the phone is not all that good
1	3 ) the joystick design they are using on the new nokias gives you a great degree of control
1	this camera is truely superb
1	7 ) some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch
1	i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player
0	the depth adjustment was sloppy
1	mine is as easy to use as the mini without any firmware download
0	2 ) not very ergonomically you 'll find even for a point and shoot lens )
1	has a great helpline
1	all in all , its good enough for its price as long as it doesnt break again due to normal use
0	) can 't be left in the car it immediately shuts down with an overheating error if left in a hot car for too long
1	on the up side , the phone has amazing battery life
1	another thing i like about this camera is the way that you can swap colors around and the impressive video quality i would advise any person in the market for a camera to pay the little extra on the hefty 500 price tag and get a quality camera
1	this one is really great
1	it is small enough to fit easily in a coat pocket or purse
1	when i played back a symphony orchestra you would swear that you were seated dead center in front of the orchestra it 's that good !
0	6 ) the case occludes the display screen when it is closed
1	small size
1	despite a critical start , this phone deserves four stars because it accomplishes what it sets out to do ( which is pretty lofty ) does more than most does it well is dependable
1	3 ) the champ is odor free for at least 15 months
1	unless you have an enormous music audio book library , the 20 gb model should have more than adequate storage capacity , with a stated ability to hold 5000 songs
1	best camera ever from the image quality , color , function , i can say almost everything
1	let the champ win you over !
0	4 ) the viewfinder is bordered lcd skying
0	stay away from this junk
0	the digital zoom is crap
1	my sd500 focuses flawlessly , does not whine during video , and my pictures are razor sharp
1	the product i rate five stars ,
1	i still give the ipod five stars , though , as it could have been something i did incorrectly during the install ( though i did follow the onscreen prompts ) so i 'll give apple the benefit of the doubt
0	i 've read about the issues with the scroll bar , but they must have taken care of that now
0	the panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said
0	unfortunately , the player would not read any of my region one dvds even though they were not damaged in any way
1	also , the wma compression format is superior to mp3 , especially at lower bit rates , so i needed a player that could handle wma and integrate well with my windows xp computers
1	it has raised the bar owing to number of features it offers and the absolute ease of use delight
0	i 'm currently using a sony vaio s 150 ( which i bought at the end of this past august ) , and it takes about five minutes just to boot the system in fact , i 've taken to just hibernating , rather than shutting down completely
1	it holds almost a week 's worth of diapers , and you don 't need expensive refills any kitchen bags work
1	no need to pay for the special refills that the other brands require !
1	1 ) the champ is easy to use
0	about the only legitimate criticism from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder
1	i am happy with the fact that i can use any bag in there and dont ' have to pay out the nose for replacements
1	the nikon coolpix 4300 is wonderful easy to use , high quality , and compact in size
1	colors 10 variety of hot colors made it difficult to choose from
0	the creative zen micro is a zen micro killer , not an ipod killer
1	9 3x built in optical zoom is a lot for this price range
1	to keep it short , this is cheaper , and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod
0	luckily the soft start helped before it took the wood and tossed it or worse case , a finger
0	i just wished that it didn 't fill up so fast !
0	do not buy this product
0	the adjustment knob seemed ok , but when lowering the router , i have to practically pull it down while turning the knob
1	i wo n 't go into the details here , as the online sites ( steve 's digicams , previews ) go into great depth in their reviews , but i am very pleased with the features , the speed , the picture quality , the flexibility , the automation , and the functional conveniences this camera offers
0	not only is it inconvenient , but also the battery life span is short
1	absolutely no problems with this router
0	the linksys technical support site has nothing about configuring the router for use with a mac
0	i am annoyed that the player 's not automatically recognized as a hard drive
1	also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player
0	when the player was working it was great , but
1	it works easily with one hand , which is important
1	3 ) the nomad explorer ( winxp style interface ) works well to transfer files back and forth to use the nomad as an external although the tech support web site states that the primary intended purpose of the player is as a player
1	especially for the price amazon gives it at ( i was unable to get mine through amazon due to some credit complications )
1	it works well enough ( so far ) for me to be satisfied with it , and it 's possible that i 'm missing something
1	audio formats supports both mp3 , wma and yeah , wav too
0	i did it and it was worse the second time around unbelievable
1	reliability build i dropped the player once from about 4 ft , and it fell hard , but kept on playing
0	the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out
0	pc software that comes with the player is not as simple as i tunes but its not bad at all
1	you can manage your profile , change the contrast of backlight , make different type of display , either list or tabbed
1	the height adjustment knob is a bit flimsy , but it works well and provides good accuracy
0	relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots
0	creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality , poor product support , difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack
1	the computer interface is 90 good , only losing points due to the fact that creative branding is all over the place within it
1	yes , the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range
1	it also works just fine for international calls
1	and it 's the largest diaper pail i 've seen without taking up more floor space
1	after installation , which was very simple i downloaded any updated software from the creative website , before i downloaded any music
1	it 's the same body as the popular elp2 aps camera ( take a look at a standard credit card from your wallet and you 'll have an idea of the front profile ! )
1	ripping the songs , even with my 1 1 usb connection is still very quick , and the quality is very good
1	i use the regular kitchen trash bags and it is so easy to empty
1	the plunge lock and power switch are very easily accessible which is a must when doing free hand routing
1	before you run out and buy an ipod , understand something there are reasons the zen is worth encountering this kind of hassle , principally excellent ( for mp3 ) sound quality
1	we tried it out christmas night and it worked great
1	the auto focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes they are dummy proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera
0	the setup process for the nomad is infuriating , and the interface with the player is sub par
1	this product is amazing and better than the ipod you can get at the same price
0	also , some other mp3 players such as the nitrus allow you to play wma ( windows media audio ) files , whereas the ipod does not
1	equipment included is average , but that is n 't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for
1	the power , low noise operation , and speed control makes up for the problems i have experienced
0	all in all , the diaper champ serves its purpose , but it does not live up to its good reviews
0	i tried to use the fm radio option , but it doesn 't seem to really pick up the stations i listen , however i am going to try it in a different location , it may have just been my residential location
1	3 ) 4x zoom is nice
1	i upgraded both my card and router and really had no problems with installation on my sony vaio laptop ( xp operating system )
0	i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver
0	the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd )
1	it really is a great buy if you are loo kin at having just one modem but many computers around the house
1	i love the rounded edges now , fits so much better in a pocket , jeans or suit
0	too bad the product is cumbersome and intertwined trying to do so much at one time
1	it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing !
1	the 6610 excels as a cell phone , thank god
1	handsfree future is good , but not too exciting
1	i think it 's great
1	also , it takes any kitchen sized trash bag , so there is no special bag to stock
1	) no locked in proprietary business like apple this baby plays wmas too
0	i know the saying is you get what you pay for but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this there is no excuse
1	6 the nikon coolpix line is a well established line so you know support and parts are going to be available even when nikon releases a newer model
0	even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image
1	its also smaller , and gets more looks
1	for the price and features it is really good
1	it is an extremely cool cozmo
1	the software is very easy to use , and within 30 minutes of opening my box , i was out and about listening to any one of my 80 cds
1	i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer
1	this camera is ideal for people who want more power , but do n 't want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera
1	frankly , i think this is one of the niftiest pieces of hardware i 've ever used
0	it would either not play the song at all , or skip wildly , no matter that the unit was resting on my desk
1	moreover , apart from the plastic cable cover , the camera has a nice , solid feel about it , and it 's so tiny , i take it with me wherever i go
1	the software that comes with the digital elph is very nice and intuitive
1	2 it is easy enough for my grandmother to use
0	the locations of various buttons on one side or the other is somewhat illogical
0	first , let me say that i got the 20gb ipod for christmas , and i most likely would not have spent the 300 myself
1	its the easiest thing to setup i thought , and i am only 16 so with all that said , buy the router ! ! ! !
0	b ) the screen is hard to read the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display
0	they are a royal pain to install , and don 't function properly once finally installed if you can install them at all
1	however , if there was one thing i liked about the creative , it would be the car adapter
1	i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd 's transferred
1	the program is fully featured , with much of what you 'd want from a security program
1	overall it is a great unit hopefully creative labs or some other vendor will soon come out with some accessories for it
1	sending the unit to the company of purchase which costs about 90 ) , the ability to record with a built in microphone ( great for recording reminders and meetings ) , very sturdy construction , and not to mention the sound quality is excellent !
1	and really this is the best phone one could have
0	this was an awesome player , before the video output no longer worked ( after about 3 weeks )
0	what disappoints me the most that a software like that is not cheap gets zero support form symantec , if you want support , they 'll charge you a fee !
1	there are number of downloads needed available for this phone they will be text ed to you at no cost
1	we just use the glad tall kitchen trash can bags with odor shield from target and they work wonderfully
1	placement of the buttons and software user interface is near perfect
0	i have overall been disappointed with nokia in the past , finding that samsung and motorola tended to have better quality phones
1	so much safer than the others that require a two handed operation !
1	i 've owned many norton products in my time , and for the most part , i 've been pleased with their performance
1	i decided to save the and opted for the zen xtra and i was not disappointed
0	but for now it appears that this player does n 't play well with itunes
0	so so 1 customer service 6 calls half were efficient other half were equally incompetent
1	there are 3 computers in my house all getting wireless connection from this router , and everybody is happy with it
0	yes , there is a belt clip , but that doesn 't hold the extra battery and usb cable
0	i gave it only 3 stars due to the fact that the 1st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance ( less than 2 ft )
0	when we tried to hook up the first one , it was broken the motor would not eject discs or close the door
1	looks sleek , compact , has a radio
0	e ) the case is too small it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage
1	i am very pleased with it so far
1	the setup was very easy
0	i think this is it 's biggest flaw
1	the system is terrific in size and design , imo looking better than the ipods
1	awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package
0	what the hell is wrong with this thing
0	after hooking the thing up , i found that it would only played less than 50 of the dvds i put in it
1	this is a great camera for you !
1	the design of the col lets is excellent and far exceeds any of the craft man ( toy junk ) routers i have previously purchased
0	the one i purchased for a friend as a gift will not read any dvd disc
1	perfect size ! beats the competition by leaps and bounds
1	the greatest thing about the software ( in my humble ) is that it reads your cd info
1	i 've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow , car , boat and wind
1	many have complained about the software included but in my opinion it 's easy to use and effective
1	the ss body is wonderful , feels high quality
0	i have a modern pc with lots of speed and memory , but this firewall just brought it to a halt
0	this is only a problem at night , during the day the screen is very easy to see
1	i highly recommend this phone
1	i 've owned this router for over 8 years and am somewhat satisfied with it
1	decent battery on the average size , but the 40gb comes with a dock
1	it was so easy my toddler would dispose of her on diapers
1	5 stars all the way !
0	i find it a bit difficult to manage the very tiny buttons and impossible to read the icons without my reading glasses on
1	so reliability is the winner here for the ipod
0	the phone must be shut down taken apart to change the memory card and turning the phone back on takes a little while
1	overall i 'm happy with my toy
0	sure , it 's a little bigger than the ipod , but not by much
1	for the price i think this is a remarkably fun mp3 player
0	then my dvds would stop playing in the middle , or not even be read at all
1	all i have to say is that the pics i get with my sd500 are both rich and color and high in detail , the user interface is awesome , the battery charger is tiny and super light and sd cards are relatively cheap and getting cheaper all the time
1	the sound quality is fantastic ( cd quality ) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes !
1	as opposed to the nomad ii or any other flash based player , the songs load extremely fast about one or two seconds per song
1	i 'll be getting a second one for my router table !
0	i 've had to install and uninstall them four or five times so far , and i 've not to get either product working properly
1	the phone has such advantages as the excellent keypad and display , long rundown time and a good software suite
1	by no means do you have to be a tech junkie to be able to install it , just be able to put a cd in the computer and it tells you what to do
0	both of the problem dvd 's would repeatedly freeze during playback , while the counter on the player kept going
1	i 'm very pleased with my zx so here 's a quick review
1	i love this pail !
0	it is more than 90 days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do
0	the subscription files are still a little slower to transfer , but it 's only by about 10 or so
1	excellent sound i mean the player has juice
1	the diaper champ is so simple that my toddler loves to put his own diapers in the diaper champ and flip over the handle
1	this setup using the cd was about as easy as learning how to open a refrigerator door for the first time
1	along the way we compared it to my wife 's t720i and the 6600 was superior in terms of battery life , connectivity bars and features
1	the optical and digital zooms combine to give an effective 4x zoom
1	the good small size durable seeming metal case easy to use visually distinctive good picture quality fast usb connection mostly intuitive operation really cool photostitch software that knits pictures together to give wide panoramas
1	i 've had it for a week now , do n 't regret the purchase one bit , and i never leave home without it
0	respectable , solid , but not awe inspiring
1	after getting used to the m12 all the rest seemed lacking
1	well , i have an ipod mini and i really like it , but all in all , i like the zen micro more
0	i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet
0	although i disabled norton antispam , it is still there
1	sorts music by artist , album , genre , etc it 's easy to wade through 5 gigs of tunes to find what you 're looking for
1	1 small
1	since i use it in a table , i don 't use the plunge feature , but if i ever need it i 've got it
1	the sound is incredible very clean , very wide dynamic range of bass , midas and highs , and can be very loud if i turn it up full blast
0	the headphone jack seems to be a major problem
0	first thing i noticed was that the creative wasn 't well made
0	some adjustments in the settings could help make it better
1	i just received my 40gb zen xtra yesterday and i 'm extremely pleased with it
1	very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price
0	first of all , i bought this dvd as a christmas present for my girlfriend and i am somewhat disappointed
0	lens visible in optical viewfinder
1	the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software ( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth )
1	if you are looking for a small camera to throw in your pocket , take great pics and video , get the sd500
1	drops and strong signals even from the backyard
1	the 4300 comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win98 without problem , battery charger , usb and video cable
1	i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers , and they both delivered great results
1	battery life is ok
1	advanced photo bugs will find more creative control than imaginable
1	operating its many features is easy and often obvious i 'm no annie levitt 's , but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store
0	after several years of torture in the hands of at t customer service i am delighted to drop them , and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family phones from at t to t mobile !
0	what this product really needs is better documentation for how to set up the router for different operating systems !
1	the phone book is very user friendly and the speakerphone is excellent
1	it is much easier to fill and unload than the diaper genie , plus , why buy refills when you can use trash bags from the dollar store ?
1	7 have a good chunk of my small mp3 to listen through the speaker phone
0	i 'm probably the only person that dislikes the itunes software
0	you can 't do that with a sony t610 ( which i traded for a 6600 )
0	not plug play relies on id3 no fm or recording
0	2 the camera is so small that when you attach some lenses i have the 19mm wide angle wc e 68 , the optical viewfinder is partially obscured
0	one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough
1	i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down now buy it !
0	the instant setup button in the front of the router messes up the network it is better to configure the router manually
1	they were easy to setup with plenty of power to hog through anything i have encountered
0	this is definitely one of those products , especially as the company is leaning more towards making a profit
1	the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand
1	actually using the nomad jukebox is easy and uncomplicated
1	i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like
0	limitations not a lot of original accessories like the ipod
1	the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit
1	i also use the phone as my modem via bluetooth to my apple power book !
1	unlike other reviewers , i like the tool because it is easy to operate outside of the router table
0	configuring it for a home network was almost impossible
1	looks snazzy smaller than a pack of smokes easily transported ac charger included as well as a hard shell that comes with a clip and a stand adapter usb cable !
1	i highly recommend this !
1	connect the player to your computer ( via usb ) , open up mediasource , and you can listen to your stored mp3s as they stream directly from the xtra !
0	i had to sit on the phone with customer support for 2 hours and they did not help at all
1	great picture quality in automatic mode , quality is great
0	5 ) video recorder is of no use and one can not record something useful in 10 seconds and it takes a while to send the same through the free picture and video messaging offered by service provider
1	it has lots of little cute features , my favorite being the games and the pim ( personal information manager i e organizer ) , and the radio !
0	even the pdf manual that comes with it is pretty vague for someone not familiar with mac settings , etc
0	1 your hitachi might come to you with a stiff spring mechanism
1	i bought this little guy a few weeks back , and i have to say that i never had so much fun with a new toy as this
1	the camera is adequate and if i want high res photos i 'll use my digital camera instead
1	not only is it more affordable , but its a better player for windows , which is what i have
1	the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent , and finally the price , 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent
1	lots of flaws , but exceptional sound quality , hd size , and price make it a good buy
0	i assumed they had exceptional service , but their reception in my area ( laos angele 's ) is horrendous
1	there are really easy directions for setup and fiddling around with the picture , zoom etc
0	door broke after a month
0	( ) like most soho routers , it has nearly non existant logging
1	i love my new nomad , its great !
1	the controls are on the side instead of on the front , which i like , because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing !
1	it all sounds great too
0	to use the creative zen player with a subscription service , you need to go to creative 's web site , and download new software for your pc
1	it plays basically every media i 've tested so far , even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could n 't be played on my old 200 sharp player !
1	the design , as mentioned above , is sleek , cool and trendy ( and i think trendy good , but it 's always hard to tell these days )
1	many people have written about the software being its one downfall , personally i have n 't had a single problem with the software , i 'm running windows me
0	user 's guide doesn 't cover a lot of important info that is covered on their website
0	the songs do n 't play one after another like on a cd
0	the flywheel you use for most of the navigation was n 't in tightly and it was uneven as far as the amount of pressure to make it engage
1	the controls and the menus are clearly displayed and easily fathomed
1	you 'll love it !
1	i love that you can create custom playlists , and organize music in so many different ways
1	however since this router is backward compatible , that doesn 't pose a problem at all
1	linksys quality and tech support have been outstanding
1	so far it all works fine with either cable or wireless connections
0	the buttons on the phone are small , even for my small fingertips , but you get used to them rather quickly
1	it comes with a good case that fits it snugly
0	crappy headphones
0	as an engineer , i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale
0	creative software stinks
1	other than that , i love this camera
0	i wash ours out with lysol each time i empty it , and that helps , but when its hot out well , just be prepared
0	the cons , at times the diaper wipes get stuck in the disposal area making it hard to turn the handle back and forth
1	the extra spare battery is just a neat bonus
1	the zen was an impressive purchase and i would highly recommend it to anyone using napster
1	less than a cheap cordless drill or a laminate trimmer
1	this is really a no brain er
1	apart from speed , the signal is consistent and works without interruptions , etc
0	the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless
1	photos are pretty darned good !
1	the ipod is not overpriced compared to the market
1	has the click wheel and the ability to scan through thousands of songs and organizes them great
1	i also wanted to switch to broad com hardware ( which the linksys uses ) because my wifi menisci card in my dell laptop with lucien silicon in it used 70 of my 1 2ghz laptop 's cpu when using the wireless at full speed
0	the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image affecting settings in the camera
1	the headphones have great sound and durability and mine came with some extras when i bought it ( a stand , a belt hook , charger ) that i know doesn 't come with every one
0	also , not liking the gel case
1	the 6600 ( t mobile ) is the true 'world phone ' in that it has the mhz to operate around the globe , including new zealand and australia ( 900 ) whereas the 6620 ( available from singular ) replaces it w 800mhz ( some refer to as 850 )
1	one of the best cell phones i have ever used to date
0	will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles ( if you have live albums or greatest hits albums , this will cause you inordinate frustration )
1	battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k reeves
0	the 2600 had false silver plate instead of play display
0	i give it 4 stars only because the installation process or rather problems that may surface during the installation process can be frustrating to the average computer user
1	i ended up buying one for upstairs and one for downstairs because it works so well and because i change him so often downstairs
1	color screen is good
0	difficult navigation i wo n 't necessarily say difficult , but i do n 't enjoy the scroll wheel to navigate
0	the remote is okay , but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons
0	only then did i learn the truth this phone does not work with palm pdas !
0	my case doesnt close maybe mine was just faulty , but the case isnt that great
0	even on the low sensitive level , a slight touch can skip or pause the track
1	i 've printed several photos and the prints look as good as the screen views
1	at 8 ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod
1	this is a great diaper pail
1	i just went on a quick photo shoot in nyc 's central park today , and what a bunch of beautiful photos i took , if i do say so myself ( and i do ! )
0	only problem is that is a bit heavy
1	very small
0	video output stopped working
0	i sent creative customer service 3 emails in which they did not help me one bit and don 't seem to even want to help
0	its size makes holding it steady for long a bit of a challenge ( not enough camera body to grip with more than your finger tips )
1	the storage capacity is great
1	at double speed ( 2x forward speed ) , it still plays mp3s with sound they are pitch corrected and smooth , but twice as fast !
0	it is a bit cumbersome , and i can 't get to the songs i want as quickly
0	they said they would refund all the money , but a month later , they tell me now the back up disc is not refundable as its cost is purely handling and shipping 15 to handle and ship a cd ? and they have been indignant and combative on the phone and in emails
1	it is far better than just a trash can or the diaper genie and it 's fairly inexpensive as baby products go !
0	it is embarassing getting phone calls from family members telling you that the dvd player you gave them less that 3 months ago is no longer working
1	i have no problem using the player itself and i feel it is a very good player
0	if you are already using a previous version of nortron security and uni stalled it to install the new version , you will still have all kind of problems in installing the new version on your system !
1	its fast forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i 've had
0	apex 's website is down and they wo n 't answer their phone
1	at first i had a problem with some smell , then i realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in then there is no smell at all !
1	the router has plenty of power for any type of bit or wood i need to cut , and the speed control knob is easy to get to
0	the software that came with it was tough to load
1	i researched and researched between getting the canon s20 or the canon s100 , and of course i got the latter !
0	i was using a motorola t720i with verizon and i had alot of dropped calls and i had troubles syncing data
1	the bass is deep and the treble is clear
1	the camera is a dream to operate in auto mode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes
1	and for those that are int rested the recharger works anywhere in the world ( and is quite small )
0	i 'm convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed , and will not hold up to normal use
1	this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature , to find out more just log on to canon 's website
1	great sound ! i was very impressed , i encode at 192 kbps and the audio quality is great , especially with the better headphones
1	it is crystal clear
1	especially the lcd is big and the camera quality is among the very best around
0	2 ) the delay from the time you fully depress the shutter to the time the picture is taken is too long and may yield some fuzzy shots
1	we don 't have to worry about running out of refills with this diaper pail !
1	ripping transferring tunes is basic , and pretty fast ( even on a 1 1 usb )
1	i recommend t mobile and the nokia 6600 without reservation
1	utility its got a huge list of features including an fm recorder a calender and contacts list
0	4 ) buttons are quite small and is really a pain exp if one is fond of text messaging
1	but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in auto mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it !
0	some dvd 's i rented would not play
1	everything , so far , has worked flawlessly
1	not counting the time i spent editing the songs ( i suppose i should 've done it anyway on my pc ) the transfer was pretty painless
0	first of all , i 've never been big on earbuds they 're just not that comfortable
1	that 's it for now , what are you doing still reading this , click the add to cart button already !
1	it 's very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout , and it has a great feature set
1	m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) it does n 't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music creative or any other company all my 12 5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags hooray !
1	the included earphones are pretty good my advice ?
1	this is an excellent router for the price
1	it may not top the ipod mini , but it 's definitely an alternative if you also want the extra features and good sound quality
1	i also like the fact that you can edit your mp3 titles , etc
1	if you are using linux , and you want to use gprs to connect to the net , i suggest this phone along with a belkin usb bluetooth adapter
0	size bigger than the ipod
1	1 the diaper champ doesn 't require special refills that are expensive and hard to find !
1	the size is small ( just a little bit bigger than an i pod )
1	so easy to set up , had some problems with my archos
1	the antivirus feature is phenomenal , and is regularly updated
0	it has never worked
0	the pc side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated
0	one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu
1	naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing ( i recommend www no madness net ) , and price wise zens are unbeatable
0	i am bored with the silver look
1	anti spam is good
0	i thought this camera was awful and i did tons of research on cnet and other sites
0	the inside pics , can be a bit challenging , but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like , that are not focused perfectly , or need lighting adjustments , make this camera very simple and effective
1	even though you could get a cheap router these days , i 'm happy i spent a little extra for the linksys
1	you can use the player to store your computer data files ( good feature to have )
1	about the product the zen micro is a sleek , stylish device that caters not just to hip youngsters but to people of all walks of life who like to listen on the go without having to worry frequently about battery life , size , or the awkward factor
0	deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with 3rd party earphones ( 20 ) and software ( 25 )
0	as a loyal customer of norton symantec products , i purchased internet security 2004 as a software firewall and could not be any more dissatisfied with the product ( and hence the one star rating )
0	in any case , navigation by artist album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders
0	the player itself has all sorts of problems
1	so sit back , relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can 't do half the things this one can , and for a fraction of the price !
1	i 've been using nis 2004 for about 2 months and it works well
1	price and capacity
0	unfortunately , it does not give you the option of installing ( or installing ) them individually
1	a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging how could one eat rice one grain at a time ) )
0	as it stands now , the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the player up for travel , or if you load up all your songs beforehand
0	even though i have the parental controls off it constantly starts updating them then freezes my computer
0	can 't get easier than that !
1	i think sound quality should be the first and foremost feature , and the zen is leaps and bounds better in sound quality , with no need to upgrade the earphones
1	another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen
1	could be better to be a perfect camera ( and some competitors do some of this better ) purple fringing , details in high light area , noise over iso100 , red eyes , ( few ) processing artefact 's , ( few ) loss of some details especially of the hairs of peoples in low light , automatic autofocus , whizzing while video playback , better video compression ( smaller viedo files ) , more manual controls , longer lasting battery , indicator for battery , better protection of the lcd , less weight
1	( we wrap them nice and tight ) we use our regular kitchen trash bags cheap !
1	the fm tuner , the 5g of storage , and the removable disk are all great features
0	on the plus side it 's packed with features , including bluetooth that works fine it 's really a tiny computer that is also a phone and that 's the negative
0	the other pail i used started to smell after 2 weeks of use
0	but when we went to use it again , there was sound but no picture
1	even leaving it on the default setting ( without the eax enhancements ) produces crystal clear playback
1	as often mentioned , the scroll tab is average , however , not difficult to use or horrible
0	i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does n 't seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as ( i believe ) the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked
0	the touchpad is virtually unusable sometimes you have to press like mad to make a selection and other times the slightest brush causes something to be selected that you don 't want
0	if you want to purchase a real case or container or clip on carrier for you zen micro , expect to purchase it separately and to dish out big time
0	the controls are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this
0	as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away !
0	i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust
0	what a disappointment !
0	you 'll do that because the keys are tightly packed in and your fingers will likely press two keys at once
1	unlike other reviewers , i have found the support to be responsive , almost no wait time on the phone , and relatively knowledgeable
0	the achilles heel of this router is its inability to stream music , or copy large files over the local network
0	my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags that takes a while to do if your mp3 files do n 't have them
1	our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality , great features , long battery life , and an unbeatable price
1	screen was good , easy to read
0	the only drawbacks i 've encountered are 1 indoor shots from a distance 8ft lack contrast and color , but i 've found this to be a problem with all cameras with built in flashes that i 've used even on a nikon slr
1	the router works fine for both wired and wireless
1	i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision
1	this phone has a nice blend of features without going overboard
0	) button sensitivity even reduced to the lowest sensitivity setting , the buttons are far two sensitive , really takes some getting use to , and even then , it is still too sensitive
1	digital zoom is clear too say you used all 3x optical zoom , try to do digital zoom then just try not to shake the camera at all and you 'll still get a clear good quality picture
0	i 'd recommend this is you want to wireless network your laptop , but if you want to wirelessly network a couple desktops together you might want to wait until linksys improves their desktop software hardware
0	when the screen stops working , you 're out of luck !
0	quite simply , the firmware and or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time
1	second , the setup cd actually worked perfectly
0	only one complaint about the speakerphone , you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone , not while it is ringing
1	you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does n 't make that big of a disturbance
1	it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera
1	this router does everything that it is supposed to do , so i dont really know how to talk that bad about it
0	the only downside to this is that it can get pretty stinky long before the pail is full
1	the software has n 't been a hassle for me at all
0	well , i got my second player , and right out of the box it wasn 't working right and once again , after consulting customer se !
1	best in class sound
1	we keep the diaper champ in our daughter 's nursery and her room definitely does not smell like dirty diapers
0	too difficult to change genre album track information for large number of tracks
1	the light auto correction is awesome
1	even with that , i highly recommend this router outstanding performer
1	i 've tried the free versions of zone alarm and the free version of skate and they both have a nice and easy installation and work great !
1	it is the most bang for the buck out there
0	the problems i had installing norton extended way beyond what symantec should reasonably expect the public to deal with
0	transfering i could not get my songs to completely transfer via usb 1 1 or 2 0
0	second , the menu system and controls are poorly designed
1	downloads are a snap and quick
1	great colors , pictures and white balance
1	10 great price for all the features
1	also included in the games section is the great music trivia option which tests your skill at being able to quickly place your own songs
0	otherwise , it is difficult to figure out and awkward
1	this phone has the best battery , it lasts longer then my old 3210
1	it 's really well made and has survived sliding across floors and pavement without a scratch
0	now it will not load any disk or just says that there is no disk
0	i 'm not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over 250 dollars for
1	the price is incredible with the bonus pack and hitachi 's 25 incentive ( you need the code go to tool seeker com and it tells you )
0	looks and durability i realize many people are fond of the minimalist white interface
1	the menu is easy to use and understand
1	this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones
1	i think the os and controls are very well thought out and although i 'll admit i was a bit intimidated during my first few hours with the micro , the interface and controls became second nature after the first day or so
0	so , i 've had it for a month , and the headphone jack went out
1	i upgraded from an older 801 11b router to the linksys wrt54g for its improved security , and of course , speed
1	while i had the phone , the positive features were good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece
0	you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll
1	the height adjustment works well not perfect
1	while the perfect odor free diaper pail has yet to be invented , the diaper champ is a good as it gets
1	i did notice if you turn the phone on and off the os takes a bit to load up and initially the menus are slower but once the phone has been on and booted up the menus are reasonably quicker
1	pros 1 speed 2 signal strength 3 advanced configuration options
0	they really are awfully small
1	update the finish is more mirror than silver and i like it !
1	this phone has many other features , ir , just to name one , the features above i view as the most beneficial
1	i was more excited about this player upon opening than i was about the nomad
0	after 57 pictures total the lcd went black except for the icons showing the settings
1	the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport
0	some movies it played yesterday , it wo n 't play today
1	we just recently had to buy another roll of bags so 6 00 for a year of bags can 't beat that ! !
1	longer battery life , greater accessibility to online music services , and pc compatibility are the sensibilities
0	maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing
1	it is a very amazing product
1	i would highly recommend that you do this if you want to learn something , but if you are not interested in learning this stuff and just want a working wireless router , just get the wrt54g
1	just point and shoot and the photos were great
0	it played only one out of three dvd 's without problems , the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches
1	the sound is great , and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise
1	i have n 't had time to really push this player to the limit , but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory , as should be expected from creative labs
1	you can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly
1	the fm radio is cool
1	people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either the case is sturdy and offers very good protection
1	but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive !
1	songs transfer lightning fast , and the two batteries that came in my box give me 24 hours of listen time
1	the pictures are absolutely amazing the camera captures the minutest of details
0	the only problem i find with it is that the plunge mechanism will eventually stick due to wood dust
1	i received this little jewel as a gift and i can honestly say absolutely love it
1	nikon 4300 , i feel , is the best camera out there for the features and price
0	the scroll bar again takes some getting used to
1	but canon never fails to amaze
0	there is no way the battery supplied lasts 14 hours !
0	i 've had this thing for less than a month , treated it quite well , never dropped it , and the headphone jack is all screwed up
0	3 ) the case hides the display you have to open it to see what you are doing
1	i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites
1	i installed , activated and registered nis 2004 without issue
1	but , it seems to work so well now , that i do n 't anticipate any problems with it
1	n6600 supports midi , wav , arm , mp3 etc
0	the menu options are uncreative , as you can 't see a full screen of menu items to pick from you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for ( yes , this is minor , but not when you 're trying to keep your eye on the road ! )
0	the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have
1	i love this camera !
1	the interface is simple to use
0	i will say that the os that the phone runs does have a few issues
0	it sounds decent , but i would estimate you get maybe 80 of the quality that you would from a true line out jack
1	but i wanted to do some raised panel work and needed more power and variable speed to run the large diameter bits
0	the only problem i have with the buttons is that the power button and print share button don 't have a nice click
1	i didnt have any installation problems and the touch pad is fine , even if it is sort of inaccurate
1	also , the touchpad seems to be waterproof to some degree
1	zennx 's replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod
1	at the end of the day , what i wanted was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go , and the zen xtra 's combination of price , capacity and features easily meets those criteria
1	outstanding signal reception
1	the extra gb is just a bonus
1	i bought mine in december of 2003 , and have had no real problems with it
0	update january 27th 2004 the second one crapped out only after a week dont buy this product !
1	the edge guide has a nice micro adjust feature that works well
1	the zen micro fm receiver is ok , not great
1	the instruction manuals and documentation are excellent so that the learning curve will be much less steep
1	it also costs a lot less than the ipod
1	overall this tool is very well worth the price and i have no regrets about my purchase
1	in my table the m12v has been a real champ
0	however , i am very disappointed with this product and with symantec
0	screen review could be better
1	picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from 35mm
1	it is a great router for a table and with the depth adjustment knob it is easy to adjust depth precisely
0	norton has been on a downhill slid recently with their products , but with this one , they have fallen off the cliff
1	i love the slim design the weight would only be an issue if it were bulky
0	you have to purchase that separately for some outrageous cost
1	anted to rate the router higher than 1 star , due to its security , easy of use , etc
1	ease of use design the ipod is a very easy to use mp3 player , and if you can 't figure this out , you shouldn 't even own one
1	photo stitch ( merge pictures to create a panoramic one even my old one can do this and it 's really cool to have it now still )
1	i received this item for christmas and it has met and exceeded all my standards
0	i know this unit will have problems in the future and the 40 for the 2 year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it , since creative will only warrant it for 90 days which in itself is totally ridiculous !
1	i love the quality of the pictures
1	being a very economical person , i appreciate the fact that any plastic bag can be used with this system i never did like the prospect of buying special diaper genie refills
0	as with most headphones that come with any type of music player , i recommend throwing these into the nearest river , unless you like having hard , round pieces of plastic in your ears
1	it has enough power to hog out all the material in one pass , but i usually take multiple to prevent blowout and a smoother finish
0	the box included a little polyester , pull string bag , ( yes , you read right a bag , something a boy would carry ten marbles in ) and tries to pass it off as the case
1	the documentation is much better than the documentation that came with the 11b router i needed a lot of help from linksys technical assistance to set that one up
1	this is also the case with nis 2004
1	the bottom line is phone is cool one only for the moment , as its the latest phone in the market and has all the new features , but this will soon be displaced by upcoming newer phones
1	it is great sounding , even with the supplied earbuds
0	but with a low price , comes lower quality
1	the blue light also makes this player one of the most fashionable in the market also
1	for the price , i am considering purchasing a spare just to have as a backup
0	the most recent is that it will stop responding to the on off button
1	and with usb 2 0 , transferring music to your player is incredibly easy
1	it films 10 second video , for crying out loud
0	i called apex 's support number numerous times but it just kept ringing
0	when you consider expandability ( downloads via computer ) , the numerous features , two transmission programs and multiple storage devices , dependability this is a phone that isn 't easy to out grow
0	flash as with all built in flashes in small cameras , you get over illuminated main subjects with depth being lost
0	to my amazement , even that process was error prone
1	these include mp3 , wave , wma , wma pro , and wma loss less it is very user friendly simply by right clicking the file ( s ) to be converted
1	combine this with the excellent price we got in the gold box , and i 'm really happy
0	it is some protection for the unit , but for use ability , forget it
1	all in all , it 's a good router if you don 't have the cash for a speed booster one
1	i 've played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too
0	i read in consumer reports that apex is a reliable brand , but with my experience and reading the other reviews , i think i will be doing a little more homework before considering another apex product
1	seems to work great
1	( batteries last longer too ! )
0	it 's not my first choice in cameras ,
1	the phones are awesome
0	i will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture
1	the screen is large , defined , and easy to read , and the silver unit is naturally cool
1	i compared it to other cd players ( two models of panasonic , rio samsung ) and they were no way even near zen micro
1	with the champ all you had to do was drop the dirty diaper into the opening and flip the lid
1	my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems
0	only downside is when taking pictures in low light conditions without the flash
0	i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the rigor of a business traveler
0	the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me
1	i also had no problems installing or running the camera software on my pc
1	best in class
0	on my main computer the software did not work right
1	the fact that has an open source firmware makes it a great option in my opinion
0	multiple users on one machine never seemed to behave like you 'd expect
1	so far i have no complaints with this player
1	battery life keeps improving on the ipod , and a new ipod will give you up to twelve hours of play time , per charge
1	it beats apple on the storage space , it beats apple on the removable battery ( and batter life ) , and i personally like its interface more than the ipod scroll wheel
1	4 ) one nice thing about nokias is that they have a ton of ring tone and game choices
0	yes , you may get a whiff of a smell when you flip the handle , but then it is gone
1	its ability to serve as a back up for my music collection is a huge plus
1	good color and very little needed to correct photos on paint shop pro
1	hitachi 's m12v is a big beast of a router
1	for the price i don 't think you can beat it
1	i upgraded from nis 2003 , and the change in performance has not been noticeable
1	this camera is bulletproof
1	first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint
1	4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! )
0	the day finally arrived when i was sure i 'd leave sprint
1	honestly , i love this player
0	i hope it 's because it 's new and they are not out yet , but being without a remote is hard
0	the player hangs up on file transfer every once in a while , prompting a reset
1	overall an excellent phone
1	the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me , however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate
0	3 the picture editing software it came with is adequate , but not very robust
0	1 ) player is not plug and play need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it
1	cuts are easy and smooth
0	opening the champ to empty out the bag is a little tricky i pinched my thumb a few times before i got the hang of it
1	the earbuds are great headphones as good as my ak studio 240 , well not as good but darn close
1	however , setting up using the quick start instructions was a breeze
0	within a year , there are problems with my menu dial knob
0	in addition , it only seems to work if you 're about five feet away from the player , although that may have been just the batteries that came with it
1	for more than a year , and it is totally reliable
0	i bought 2 of this model for christmas presents and neither one of them work !
1	this is one of the best purchases we made
1	transfer through windows explorer windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad
0	the speed control is recessed too far in the housing and required a tool ( screwdriver or dowel rod ) to effect any speed change
0	the volume
1	luckily , with 3 rebates this product will cost me nothing ! it is indeed worth nothing
0	after a week i tried to load some more songs and delete a few but the auto load didn 't do anything but turn on my player
1	with bluetooth off the phone last almost twice as long
1	the storage capacity is great for me
1	the player has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any
1	the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away
1	i highly recommend it if you are looking for a phone with great camera quality and or lots of features you would find in a pda
1	also , multiple picture feature is very , very fast
0	well just one con its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it , it will be a breeze
1	speaker phone quality is good , and poping in a 512mb mmc card , it rocks !
1	built in microphone is great for recording short voice notes
1	there are a lot of things i like about it
1	this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price , you can 't go wrong
1	this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has
1	it has a handsfree loudspeaker , conference and transfer !
1	first of all the player 's sound quality is superior to the ipod
0	1 ) the included lens cap is very loose on the camera
1	overall , this player is awesome and i definately recommend it
1	i am now staring at an array of stuff including zen micro player , stereo earbud headphones , a rechargeable lithium ion battery , an ac dc power adapter , a usb 2 0 cable , a belt clip , a stand , a stylish cloth pouch , an installation cd , a quick start guide , and creative mediasource software
1	you can use it as a storage hard drive
1	while , there are flaws with the machine , the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability
1	this new click wheel ipod allows you to navigate through the menus and song via a touch wheel for scrolling and click able buttons for selection
1	excellent sound quality
0	i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on line support site and their telephone line , but they wo n 't answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy
0	the ipod is overly sensitive to just about everything and gets scratched easily
1	so far the software for the pc works easily
0	unfortunately , this digital moment capturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted
1	it plays just about any format ( check before you buy if it plays yours )
1	i loaded a lot of photos into it and they display very clearly for such a small screen and , very importantly , the transition from one photo to the next is instantaneous
0	buttons do seem a little sticky tho and the hands free kits ' connector might be a problem
1	this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you 'll use all the time
0	the scroll button is sort of annoying to push a nice button would be nicer but eh , not a big deal
1	the s100 's image quality rates in the middle of its class , but it can still be a reasonable choice for students , families , or small businesses looking for an ultra portable camera that weighs less than half a pound with media and battery pack
0	i 'm an advocate of nokia , but this phone and the following models ( 7610 ) , are seemingly a desperate trial at squeezing as much under engineered and experimental technologies in one sloppy phone
1	the functionality on this camera is mind blowing
1	very simple and painless
1	bottom line if you value excellent sound quality and the ability to use music subscription services , and are willing to deal with the possibility ( not the certainty ) of setup gremlins , by all means get the zen micro
0	again , this doesn 't affect regular mp3 files just subscription drm encoded files , like those from napster to go or yahoo music unlimited
0	the wizard is particularly sinister
1	the main advantage of this system over its predecessor is the ability to open a wider pipeline between clients
1	another point of note the battery life is incredible !
1	battery life is good , although i recommend two rechargeable , or a alkaline backup , for those emergency pics you have to have
1	the thought of not having to buy refills and just using regular bags is awesome !
0	to make matters work , there is no manual override to overcome this problem
0	all the camera 's functionality is only available ( or selectable ) when the screen is functional
1	i like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets
1	everything else about the ipod is great , the click wheel is very easy to use and so is the software that comes with it
0	but after 10 days , the sound worked , but the video quit working
0	so far i haven 't had so much complaints except that i still haven 't mastered how to scandisk when using internet security
1	the phone can use any midi audio file as a ringtone
1	it 's so small
1	the af feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 3 4 of the screen and the image still looked normal
1	i enthusiastically recommend this camera
0	unfortunately it turns out to be the disposable type
0	it also does n 't have voice activated dialing big minus ! !
1	and it is extremely well priced for what you 're getting
0	it constantly drops the internet connection and simple things like walls in our house block the link so everything is very slow
1	it has several play options , one of the best is an option to shuffle , based on all or a certain playlist
1	the manual is excellent
1	i highly recommend this camera to anybody looking for a compact camera that can take good quality pictures
1	i 've had it for about 2 weeks and it 's the best player i 've seen , and used , ever
1	sharper pictures
1	the best 4 megapixel 4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use
1	a decent camera phone for taking quick pictures , movies , and having general all around fun with
0	the door would not close
1	comments overall this is still a great value , but is kind of overrated in the sense that there are beater deals on the market
1	this really is a great little phone its got nice features , a beatiful screen , great ergonomics , and its tiny !
0	i saw a few complaints on the load time of menus and i feel people are over exaggerating the menu load time
1	on the fly play list creation , address book , removable storage drive capabilities , sound recorder , the list goes on people , this thing is literally so chalked full of goodies , it was like halloween all over again
0	i couldn 't get the install wizard to work
1	it 's faster than wmp
1	i 've had nothing but good luck with t mobile
0	it has a 3x optical zoom , which is average for these cameras
0	sure they say if it 's their fault you won 't get charged , but they are the ones who get to decide whether it 's their fault
1	this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player
1	setup is totally breeze and linksys 's web site is pretty easy to navigate
1	the memory ( 40 gb ) is staggering
0	it was immediately noticeable that nis slows down my computer ( pent4 , 256 ram )
1	it also has a voice recorder and fm radio that you can only get on an ipod if you but an adapter seperately
1	the included software removes any red eye easily
1	this model appears to be especially good
1	i thought i 'd have to buy a set of headphones to use with it , but the included earbuds work quite well
1	the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot
0	the other day when i was listening to a song , it locked up and will not do anything now
0	i then tried to set up the router through linksys 's browser interface , but as the only instructions available tell you to use the installation cd , i had little luck i did manage to connect briefly , but the connection kept dropping , and with no idea of how to resolve that issue , i gave up
1	it really is the perfect travel camera , plus it offers the convenience of digital photography
1	bottom line , this camera will give you a lot of bang for the buck !
1	the wood can be pushed thru fast or slow with little bog
1	i guess the two antennae help with that besides making it look cooler
0	the hole to put the diaper in needs to be larger as i am now using medium diapers ( i have a 3 month old ) and they 're on the brink of being too large to fit no matter how compact i make then and how un soiled they are
1	i 'm sure you can read the specs above to see everything it does , but for me the best thing is that i can easily check my email , movie times , news , or any website with this phone
1	the pictures are fabulous and their is a ( short ) learning curve to it there are tons of features i have n 't even gotten to
1	i thought the software was decent enough it was n 't complicated to learn at all
0	although the sound quality is good , it takes more than good sound on a portable mp 3 player to result in a good product
1	the sound quality is excellent , accessing the music is easy , and the controls are generally well thought out
1	i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category
1	its nice look is also a plus
1	the lcd is larger than the previous model , the nx , and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx 's green backlight did
1	you can do so much more with the pc suite , i e free ringtones from midi files , free graphics from any picture on your computer , and if you know how to program jame you can even make your own apps games
1	4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome
1	battery life is awesome if you upgrade the firmware requires a windows pc or make sure to always plug the ac adapter into the player before plugging into the outlet awesome sound quality i mean it is creative right ?
0	p s the only snag i encountered while initially configuring the device was trying to hook up the micro to a front usb port the bus for the front port on my motherboard did not have enough power after connecting it to the rear ports , it works perfectly
1	thankfully , creative has come through with a product that puts the ipod back in its place
1	being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable
1	2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera ( semi serious amateur photographer )
0	i did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it was n 't a big problem
1	decently sized screen one of the larger ones on the market at 2
1	am i ever glad that i decided on this camera !
0	however , configuration of my system and actual setup of the router for wireless use took me more than 3 hours , and briefly made me reconsider my choice to for ego the airport and its notoriously easy setup
1	no matter the format
0	my only complaint ( really more of an observation ) is that the outside finish of the ipod is rather delicate , so i am going to get a case for mine so it doesn 't get all scratched up
0	the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots
1	the hands free speakerphone is quite powerful ( like the motorola phone , i used to own )
1	i find it pretty easy to use and unlike the remote interface for the audigy 2 nx ( on the pc )
1	i have it for a week now , and this camera has exceeded my expectations
1	i couldn 't believe what i had been missing
1	the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it
1	the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car , very audible even with freeway noise
1	the picture is clear , bright and sharp and the sound is good
0	i was unable achieve a sound quality on par with my simple portable cd player with bass boost
1	sound quality is wonderful , i really like the smart volume sound normalization
1	it gives great pictures , the controls are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing
1	in fact , people who have been present while i changed my almost 3 month old son 's diaper have been amazed at how the very 'potent ' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once i dispose of the diaper in the diaper champ
1	this phone has a very cool and useful feature the speakerphone
1	uploading the images to my windows based pc is very fast and simple
1	handset quality is great , as is the speakerphone quality and the headset audio quality
1	easy enough to navigate through , although i 'd prefer a sturdier button besides the thumb wheel scroll push button
1	compared to other leading dd mp3 players , the value per gb is the tops
0	the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close , a very annoying thing after ah wile
1	the handles make it very comfortable to use and i experience little vibration
0	my biggest complaint is the battery life or lack there of
0	i 've always liked symantec products , except for this version 2004
1	took hundreds of pictures and they were great
1	it can not be the computer or the owner , since i purchased mcgee anti virus 8 and it installs and works fine with no problems
1	the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies
1	it was a very quick setup and installation , in fact the disc that it comes with pretty much makes sure you cant mess it up
1	the smooth operation variable speed and a set of good masada bits will provide just the right combination for great predictable results
0	this is ridiculous
1	capacity is not a problem here
0	it would spin , read , spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc
1	it 's rechargable and supposedly easy to replace though i haven 't had to do it yet of course
1	the creative zen micro , at first glance , is a dream come true for all mp3 and music lovers
0	the disadvantages of this camera is it has been having some trouble with its autofocus on a few occasional pictures , especially quick candid shots where you start up and shot as quick as you can
1	it 's not a listed feature but , the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video
1	there is a clock , and date , which can get helpful
1	the sound quality is superb , much better than that of an ipod , in my opinion
1	way less expensive than the ipod
1	and the firewall came with a wizard which made it effortless to configure it to my lan
1	i would have given this phone 5 stars if it wasn 't for the fact that i would rather use my 3330 to do all the most common things you do with a phone
1	1 ) great audio quality overall
1	sound quality on this is amazing , as with all creative products
1	i 'm giving this player cautious recommendation
1	i love the storage in this thing
1	i have tried other pails , but none have compared positively to the champ
0	you can 't change the battery , so i don 't know what i 'm going to do in a year or so
1	this player is an ideal purchase
0	as a windows user , i had to install the software including drivers and itunes on my desktop , and this is the only area where i encountered a nuisance
1	it 's also so easy to use and holds a great deal of diapers
0	what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical
1	i 'm not overly fond of green but when i used this hitachi m12v it turns out that now i 'm very fond of it
0	i had tried to uninstall norton internet security a few weeks ago , and it wouldn 't let me do that either
0	my fingers are kind of stubby so it took a while to learn how to hit a key without hitting the adjacent ones
0	styling ergonomics the keys are small , which generally doesn 't bother me if they are spaced because i can employ a little 'braille , ' but the keys run into each other , so careful attn must be paid when dialing
0	so , you might inquire , why don 't they make it a first priority to carefully , simply explain how download music from your music library to their device ? ? ? this seems academic to me
1	i am really impressed by this dvd player
1	the ear buds that come with it look cheap , but the sound quality is amazing
1	this unit comes with the usb firewire cable as a standard item now
1	i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it
1	while i have not had the privilege , as many call it , of owning an ipod , based on the experience of friends who have had some misfortune with their ipod ( and subsequently purchased the zen touch or zen micro ) , i can pretty much rest assured that my decision to purchase the zen micro was one of the more informed ones
1	enjoy
1	this phone is one of the milestones in the history of the cellular phones
0	buy this if you like mental challenges or trying how to pick locks
1	lots of sound options , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options
0	the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built in flash
1	the picture is perfect , although i 'm not watching on an hdtv
1	i , as many others , have waited for many years for the convergence of price , features , size and ease of use to hit that happy center point
1	i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use
1	the manual is easy to understand , and it is mostly idiot proof
0	the customer support is pathetic
1	newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box
1	if you haven 't noticed , they designed it so that you can also take vertical pictures when you do the self timer
1	i also own a retail store and this little guy easily plugs into my aux slot in the store 's sound system
1	by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot , i was able to produce excellent stop action photos contrary to what other reviewers experienced
1	the earbud headphones are really nice
1	in conclusion , i gave the ipod a 4 5 because anything this expensive should would work just about flawlessly
1	i noticed that the micro adjustment knob and collet are well made and work well too
1	this is an excellent player , especially for the price , with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod
1	i 'm easily enlarging pictures to 8 1 2 x 11 with no vi sable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet ( super fine )
1	i have only used it with the 1 4 collet and a 1 2 round over bit , but i love how it starts up with little torque and runs very quietly
1	even better , with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio
1	it is nokia and thus easy to access the menu options
1	the lens retracts and has its own metal cover so you don 't need to fuss with a lens cap
0	the only downside i see is that it does n 't look like you can manage playlists from the nomad , it has to be done from the computer
1	camera is a paper weight
1	i got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon
0	battery life is about 1 4 of that advertised , no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players ( on or off line ) , occasional software lockups , replacement battery is expensive
1	the moveable lcd screen is great
0	i 've attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs , using a multitude of connection methods , and i still can 't get a video signal from the machine
0	the movies last about 5 seconds
0	the player usually plays dvd 's , but has occasional problems such as 1 ) not recognizing a dvd 2 ) stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it 3 ) not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd
1	it 's running great for all the dvds i have and rented
1	while going for a cellphone , i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones
1	very long lasting battery life
1	the arm band is fantastic and it doesn 't budge even at the gym
1	hold button suprisingly not all mp3s have this this allows you to have all the buttons unusable , so that you don 't accidently hit something in your pocket
1	i love having the option to manually control the f stop , shutter speed and even focus
0	it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs , it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies
0	other than that pictures taken in the dark are not as nice as i 'd like them ,
1	the two times optical zoom operates smoothly and quietly , and lo and behold , a two piece shutter like cap automatically slides closed over the lens when you turn the camera off
0	as one other reviewer pointed out , it does occasionally take a little effort to push down the plunger to get the diapers in the pail , even though upon inspection the bag doesn 't really look full
1	if your looking for a great sounding mini player , you can 't go wrong with the zen micro
1	i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse
0	my daughter is only 4 months old and we do notice an odor
0	but it wouldn 't let me turn the av protection back on and it wouldn 't stop with the alerts
1	i have a hard time using other phones with smaller screens ! ! !
1	so far i have used all of the above mentioned features , and find them well designed , and easy to understand
1	when you learn how to change some settings , you can make the quality even better
0	in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side mounted volume control
1	i have owned this camera for a short time and would n 't give it up for anything
1	the sound quality with jazz and pop music is equally superior
1	if you don 't mind all the buttons being touch sensitive , i 'd re comment buying it to try out , and also buy an extra 2 year warranty for it ( there are some offered here , for about 15 dollars i think )
1	you can take pictures seconds after you turn the camera on literally !
1	the interface works great
0	the first one we installed did n 't work , and our kids were devastated to say the least
1	i rarely get drawn in by mass commercialism , but something about the ipod made me say , in the words of lou and andy , i want that one ! i was willing to shell out
1	the unit itself its well structured , with just the buttons you need and none you do n 't
1	this is my second creative labs mp3 player , and it is definitely a fine product
1	bright , visible screen
0	the remote is a little hard to understand
0	our norton internet av 2004 was terrible right from the get go , so i 'd think that if steelworks is ok now , it should remain ok
1	i purchased the elph s100 mainly because i thought it was cool
0	i dont especially like how music files are unstructured basically they are just dumped into one folder with no organization , like you might have in windows explorer folders and sub folders
0	we 've purchased 3 universal remotes so far all claiming to work apex dvd players and none worked
0	it had issues right off the bat , with freezing up , staying in 'shutting down ' mode , and just not functioning very well in general
1	i love this phone
1	because it can help a so so photographer take spectacular photos !
1	what this plug in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware
1	i have had the phone for 1 week , the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i 75 , far superior to at 38 t 's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route
0	start up , log off , log on everything became very slow
1	i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots
1	i did like the heft of the machine
0	for example , i tried playing my new pirates of the caribbean extra features dvd , but this dvd player can not read it
0	like most of their solutions ( which first blame other applications for errors ) , the tech persons line was that this was probably a microsoft error it was not
0	basically the 6600 is a bundle of over hyped features you don 't and won 't need ( if you do get yourself a pda or pocket pc ) , none of them work as they should , and the basic phone functions and ergonomics are less than average
0	2 it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow
1	i find this to be a great feature
1	but , if you 're looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player , i love it !
1	the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources , you can 't do this on the ipod ( except for a cumbersome work around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player )
1	so far ( 3 weeks ) , we 've had no problems with the diaper champ at all
0	norton internet security 2004 is one of the more buggy implementations
1	it has all the features one would need in a cellphone
1	the photo quality is amazing and i know i 'm going to have fun with all the features
0	the player 's mechanics are also flawed
1	after getting one for christmas from amazon , i 'm now a believer the digital elph is truly the world 's smallest digital camera that shoots great pictures
1	even with the waterproof housing it is small
0	and , other else , the camera is still vga
1	i can use it as a modem for my computer , connect with clients and friends , the possibilities are endless
1	for those of us that like to tinker , i think creative offers some advantages
1	fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy the met 60 ct 4
1	i treat the battery well and it has lasted
0	4 ) the camera gets really hot when you are busy snapping away
1	this camera is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it !
1	i never had a single problem
1	this is the first phone i know of that has the large bright screen , infrared , bluetooth , usb connector and a speakerphone
1	received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector
0	p s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error ?
0	even with newborn diapers it filled way too fast
0	second might be a problem i might have with my pc but not too sure , when the player is connected on the usb and i start playing on it and also using the windows explorer , it sometimes pauses by itself and tries to synchronize with the pc during play , which is a bit irritating
1	regardless to this fact , i believe the champ is the best way to go
0	the first one would n 't work from the start
1	we hardly ever have to charge them , get great reception ( live in chicago ) , and the customization and applications are awesome
0	the interface software itself , which should be user friendly , was anything but easy to use
1	i have to say i 'm also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg , mp3 and mpeg files stored on cd rs dvds
1	it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime
1	the main issue now is that this new zen micro seems to be the best on the market at least temporarily
0	i 've also had the nomad zen lock up several times
1	excellent phone , the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures
1	it is extremely light and disappears in your pocket
1	it 's worth it
1	if you are looking for an upgrade , this is definitely the phone for you
0	bookmarks for example , are an excellent feature but not on this player
1	in short , the nokia 6600 is an evolution but not a revolution
0	that said , i am disappointed in the plunging mechanism
1	the bottom line for me is that i am very happy with this product
1	you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus
0	i originally gave this camera 5 stars when i had windows 98 it was wonderful but i got a new computer last november with xp the usb software is soho not compatible with xp
1	7 ) chic look and good build the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate
1	this is the third apex product i 've bought and they continue to impress for the price
1	the darn thing works as promised and it 's amazingly cheap too
1	but i was ready to upgrade and when i discovered that canon was going to come out with an even smaller digital camera with a higher resolution , i had to have the s100
0	on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd
1	it works great
1	they made the other end of the camera flat so you can put the camera upright on a flat surface if you don 't like to take the usual horizontal pictures using the self timer
1	zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player
1	what i really like about its quite , it can handle my workload and it was so cheap that i can throw it away and buy another one without blinking
1	it works with a minimum of fuss
0	right now , the creative software transfers subscription music files very slowly
0	creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was n 't as easy as i would have liked
1	i have not been disappointed with my purchase
0	the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n 't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight )
1	whether you are a novice or an expert , its ease of use and functionality goes together
1	also , the display is hinged and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage
1	as far as user interface is concerned , the best and easiest to use seems to be the one that comes with the player , 'creative mediasource organizer '
1	smooth plunging ! ( it did stick a bit so i sprayed it w lubricant
1	retraction said mine had silver plate it does have display
1	the photostitch software is very cool if you want to do any 360 degree panorama shots
1	just a little overview , powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr like camera , its 4 megapixel and ( almost ) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance
0	negative impossibly tiny and difficult to operate , barely visible , power button
1	the good 1 ) large lcd screen , colorful display , good resolution
1	all of this said as it 's on it 's way back to amazon , the one song it did include provided far better sound than the ipod
1	sure , it slows it down a little , but that 's expected
0	can 't say whether i rec 'd an updated model but it will not read dvd rw 's or vcd 's for me
1	either way , can 't go wrong with this price
0	software downloads on the site crashed my pc
1	even at the normal setting , a 8x10 print ! shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a digital
1	it has n't gone below the second notch ( i charge mine whenever i 'm at home and not using it ) , so the battery life seems fine ( so far )
1	one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software
1	all my questions or problems have been quickly and satisfactorily resolved
1	i also like the lock feature , so it makes the touch pad inactive
0	i have to move pictures off of it every day so i have room for more pictures the next , and i don 't have enough money to buy the 256 meg card that i 've had my eye on for a while
1	white earbuds ( i replaced those with some shire headphones , big difference ) , a case , a stand , a clip ( which doesn 't really work ) , and a nice little zen micro bag
0	i 've tried leaving questions on their site never to have them answered
1	getting the router setup in a vanilla configuration that works for 99 of users was very easy , and i was able to do this no problem
0	the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens
1	plus , the fact that it used regular trash bags is great
1	itunes this is a love hate relationship program usually people with mac like this program than people with a pc , but depending on your computer expertise , this could be a difficult program to use , and it is required for an ipod
1	it 's light weight enough to take with you everywhere , but powerful enough to get outstanding pix
1	i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful
1	the battery life is less than stellar , but it charges w the quickness
1	overall , i am very pleased with it
1	the zen micro is smaller than it looks in pictures , and feels very solid
1	i bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it , or have already bought it it 's size
1	anyway , this player is a great deal and i really love it
1	i can 't smell anything ( and believe me , this is quite something with my baby )
1	once you set it up , it 's great
1	if i had to do it over , i wouldn 't buy anything else
1	this year , it seems that i choose my timing perfectly , having discovered the awesome device that is the zen micro
0	its steel backing picks up fingerprints and scratches easily , not great from a cosmetic standpoint
0	cons no am fm radio tuner something a large number of compete tors are doing
0	this isn 't uncommon in cameras , though , just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries , you should be fine
0	i just bought one and returned it as defective for good reason
0	but this is not documented in the zen manual neither the hard copy nor the cd version
0	well , within 45 days the video output quit working ( both rca optic )
1	looks and shape i have a black one and the first time i charged it and switched it on jeez the blue light looked so cool
0	the nomad zen could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case
0	mine generally requires a charge every 48 hours or so and i don 't really talk on it that much
0	it 's as though nokia has segregated 90 of the screen for fancy features rarely used and leave just 10 for the day to day use
0	the customer service dept did not list a toll free number and it was a real hassle to get through on their regular line
1	i 've had this beauty for nearly 2 months now and i truely love it
1	) one outstanding positive feature is the battery it holds a charge for a long time , longer than most other similar products and the user can replace it easily or take another along as a backup
1	8 ) creative mediasource , although not as sleek looking as windows media player , is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cb service ( gracenotes )
0	while light , it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets
0	however , this product performed well below my expectation
1	the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable !
0	the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i 'd have liked them to be
1	the sound is quite good , in terms of volume
1	really happy with this little camera
1	it is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder , but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree ear piece which is included
1	i would put the hitachi up with the best !
1	have a great and easy to use bundled software
1	with the ipod , you can also store documents and contact files ( from programs such as microsoft outlook ) when it 's connected to your pc as an external hard drive
0	the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone else 's is too
1	the blue backlight is pretty cool
0	other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better
1	and , with the ipods ' full volume up , all you have to do is adjust your receivers ' volume and your set , since the ipod itself acts as a strong amp lifer of its ' own
1	goes 3 days after a charge
1	i love this camera
1	the transmission speed is also quite good , with pages loading very quickly
0	at first glance , i thought this phone was a little too big for me , maybe a little too complicated
1	having done all this , i was quite pleased to see that all corners i needed were decently covered by the signal
1	i would recommend this camera unequivocally !
0	also , diapers tend to stay in the middle , causing the pail to get backed up
0	also , their t zones , although cheap ( 4 99 mo ) never works
1	i give this product five stars for its usability , performance , expandability , and definitely looks !
0	the new hardware version does not run linux at all and most likely will not since the memory has been cut in half
1	the micro seemed like an ipod for less
0	on average , indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm
1	i find the apex ad 2600 to be a great buy
0	a lot of fragments were left in the registry , and it the norton system folders
1	i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit
1	there are so many functions in this little , yet powerful camera !
1	the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them
0	this has happened with several different dvd 's and occasionally if we keep trying something , it will work when it did not work one time before
0	i really regret signing up with t mobile , but i 'm stuck with them for the next 6 months of the contract
1	i like this router a whole lot better the linksys 11b router it replaced the signal strength seems ot be much strainers , seldom falling below the very good range ( and most often excellent within 25 50 feet of the router
1	it is very easy to change bits without removing the router from the table and the shaft lock works great
1	other than this , i am very pleased with the router and would buy it again
1	it doesn 't bog down under load
0	in fact , each of my creative mp3 players had software problem in the first place
1	setup in xp was instant and intuitive
1	the software is great
0	it just tells you to start disconnecting and attaching cables without any input as to whether your current setup includes a pre existing router ( mine does ) , without any clarity as to whether you should be running the wizard on a hard wired pc or a wireless equipped pc
1	there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone , it is a great phone , mine worked without any problems right out of the box
1	you actually can talk to a real person for support in under an hour ! )
1	i 've had no problems w this phone
1	the pictures are razor sharp , even in macro
0	my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software
1	it takes great pictures
0	it took several days of attempts before things finally worked again and i have n 't a clue why
1	i highly recommend this phone to anyone
1	but like i stated , its better then a trash can , but i 'm not sure if its better then the diaper genie
0	1 a cell phone is to make calls , in other words , quality of reception and mic speaker are the most important , the 6600 has a relatively low volume speaker , you 'd have to press it hard against your ear to hear anything the other person is saying , unless the surroundings were completely quiet
1	it was a good player when it worked and i loved the design
0	also if you do manage to get it installed , any problems with liveupdate or with system works will also affect the functionality and or the process of updating internet security
1	you can record your voice and turn it into a ringtone
1	recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m 4m pixel fine combos and many of the user friendly functions are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately
0	canon 's g3 does it consistently
1	noiseless , lightweight and oh yeah
1	the only free help you get is in renewing your subscription !
0	we have had this product for over a month and yesterday it stopped working
0	mine was so bad i had to to use a hammer to free it ( and this is why i 'm giving it 4 , not 5 stars )
1	4 ) usb 2 0 means fast data transfers ( 1 song sec ! )
0	all that said , i am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera
0	rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area , the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made
1	this is my first mp3 player and i am so impressed with what such a small device can do
1	the battery stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter
0	regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop
1	seriously ! i love it !
0	i sent it back , as i think that the speed control is either poorly designed or defective
1	the build quality feels solid , it does n 't shake or whine while playing discs , and the picture and sound is top notch ( both dots and dd5 1 sound good )
1	i enjoy getting use to the touch pad
0	at the very least , a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice
1	the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me
1	the battery life is not that of the casio 's but its good and your going to get better pictures in my opinion with the battery life you 've got
1	finally , compare the ipod to other players on a cost gb , and also consider ease of use
1	the zen micro is near perfect
1	the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone , saved me hours of re entering my numbers
0	1 the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod , and it weighs a little bit more
1	at 128 the songs sound very good
0	the flaw is inside the zen
0	speaker volume is loud and clear but it sacrifices the battery life
1	the appearance is okay ed ( at least not ugly )
0	putting the micro into your pocket could trigger just about anything ( unless the hold feature is improved it asks if you want to unholy for every button up press ) second , i 'm worried about the durability of the player
1	i 'm extremely glad i bought this camera
0	it locked during install and i had to reformat the drive and start from scratch ( greer ! )
1	anyway , my wife got this for me for my birthday and i love the thing
1	camera quality isn 't bad for the low resolution
1	they 're pretty comfortable , stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality
1	i think their antivirus software was one of , if not the best , on the
1	the scroll button seems ok , i have no problems with it
0	the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod , but i have gotten use to them , and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price
1	when i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd r media disc 's that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could n 't get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with
1	works perfectly with my netgear wireless paramecia
0	it would work fine for a while then as the motor warmed up it would die
1	pros excellent sound , even with the headphones that come out of the box , but it absolutely rocked with my bose quiet comfort 2 set
1	i 've been using the g3 for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it 's advertised
0	another irrigation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long , it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on
1	5 the price is right
1	just follow the instructions carefully , it 's all based on a cd that has everything you need to get you up and running in no time
0	that 's when it went from oder less , to odorous !
1	the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class
1	other plusses changeable battery , loads of presets for environments , decent construction , still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod
1	some features that the 'zen micro ' has that sold me on my purchase include a 5g hard drive actually an sd flash card drive very large and much more than actually needed , the ability to sync with microsoft outlook 's calendar , the long battery life of about 10 to 12 hours ( i can change the battery myself for about 40 to buy vs
0	it wouldn 't always work seamlessly with wmp and it often required me to restart the frozen micro by taking out the battery and restarting it
0	many of our disney movies do n 't play on this dvd player
0	and i can 't warn you enough to stay away from norton ! !
1	i 've had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision
0	the video recorders a bit odd , sometimes i get 9 secs on my recordings , sometimes i get 17
0	almost from the beginning , liveupdate would not function
1	good looks
0	forget about the sleek looks if it can 't play some of your real dvds
0	i took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended
1	but that is good for me because symantec soft wares are a bit hard to master for me who are not savvy on computers
1	this did manage to cut the number of pop ups during start up from 4 down to 2
1	really like it , easy to use , great images , very intuitive , fits in my jacket pocket
0	i could hardly use it without a recharge in 2 days !
1	the look feel i have the black one and the contrasting neon blue on the buttons add a very nice ambiance
1	yes , the 1 800 number probably redirected me to someone in india , but the guy was easy to understand , and he helped solve the problem
1	learning how to use it will not take very long
1	i love the touchpaper controls
1	the zen micro ( mine 's black ) has a lot going for it
1	the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use
1	outside of the t mobile service area the phone seamlessly jumped onto at t wireless and various other services where the t mobile service was unavailable
1	it 's easy to install the security on this product but linksys doesn 't do a good job of explaining why its important
1	a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories , as always
1	great phone , easy to use , excellent network , no regrets ! ! !
0	it could be a little bit bigger , but it 's easy to get used to
1	well linksys was one of the original big players in the router industry
0	i hope you have a magnifying glass , because the number displayed as well as most of the pop up options are tiny
1	putting in mp3 player , lots of games and application to download
0	eax equalizer accentuates diminished quality of mp3 files
1	my favorite features , although there are many , are the speaker phone , the radio and the infrared
0	i am seriously considering purchasing another wrench and just not using the sliding wrench which comes on the router
0	nice machines , but i consider their quality pretty low now
1	yes , i recommend it over the competition
1	a great camera , but here are some points which i don 't notice in most of the reviews here , which may be of concern especially to the more advanced amatuer
0	first , the cons a tad bulky not the most aesthetic looking player and does n 't support a folder structure
1	it 's easy for beginners to use , but has features that more serious photographers will love , so it 's an excellent camera to grow into
1	there is an alarm , i still havent used it yet , but it should be good
1	the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy , and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player , so it wo n 't take up space on your pc hard drive
1	in fact , i liked it so much after using it with my son who is now 2 years old , that i bought one for our new baby 's room
1	battery life is exceptional , lasting longer than the 8 10 hours that seem reasonable with most music players on the market
0	unfortunately , i sold it exactly a month later
1	the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine
1	i just replaced my old linksys router with this one , turned everything on in the right order , and it was up and running with no problems
1	5 excelent software package
1	i simply love this feature
1	creative did an awesome job with the design
1	it has many great features and very few bad ones
1	i was an early purchaser of the wrt54g , and had a few problems with stability and speed finally , the march 03 firmware update has resulted in an excellent product !
0	i tried calling the support number for a week , several times a day , and always got a busy signal
1	the setup was a breeze , i had some reservations about a wireless network ( see my review for linksys wet11 ) but this item was on sale as well as the wet11 so i just had to splurge
1	it 's easy and really works , with some incredible range
1	ks almost without fail , no matter what your taste in music is from relaxation music to hard rock , to hip hop , to korean and japanese , to afro cuban and salsa , jazz , blues , country and pop , this feature performs well
0	very annoying
1	i was fortunate to get the packaging that still included all the accessories ( desk stand hard case , belt clip , wall charger , etc )
0	it 's too bad , though , that !
1	the high resolution screen is easy to read and has a backlight
0	it takes a while to learn how to use it right , and at this point i am able to make about 70 of my calls using it
1	the digital zoom takes as good of pictures , as the optical zoom does !
1	four megapixels is great
1	then sorting the files is easy as pie
1	i can connect to my computer via bluetooth to transfer images , calender events , contacts and anything else
0	the support has been less than impressive , considering the cost
1	this is the fourth version of systemworks and the second version of internet security that i have used and it has always been a favorite
1	we lysol the champ every time we change the bag out and have not had any problems
0	if you call apple and tell them your ipod has been damaged , they charge you roughly 105 50 per minute and blame you for abusing your ipod
1	even though i never ventured into the cloth land , i was very impressed by how well this works at keeping diapers and their accompanying odor in the pail and out of our life !
1	overall , a good buy for the price
1	not only is it the perfect size ( not too small , not too large ) , it also has all the features a high tech phone user would want
0	after reading reviews of lcd problems , cracked , black blobs etc , i figured that it was probably a very limited problem
0	you can set the optical zoom before shooting and than while shooting video adjust a digital zoom in and out however due to the cameras light weight camera shake is a problem to contend with
0	on several different occasions it has displayed no disc with a disc inside
1	this is probably one of the few dvd players at 40 that can play almost everything you throw at it
1	yin to point out they have experience , and so the reliability of the connection you get is among the best
1	i love it ! !
1	for me , it is as important that the tool be comfortable to use as it is that it produce a high quality result
1	it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar
1	excellent picture quality on par with my pioneer , panasonic , and jv players
0	no way to contact their customer service
0	getting the program to install properly has been a living hell experience
