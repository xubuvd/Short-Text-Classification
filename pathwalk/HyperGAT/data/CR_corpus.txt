their site offers no live help at all
works pretty well
i was worried about what the sound quality would be like , but that seems to be just as good as the actual cd sound
the canon is very small , definitely pocket size , but still easy to hold firmly
back in may 2004 , when i first reviewed this , it had taken me over 16 hours to install and run
little to no networking experience , just in case the automatic cd method has issues
i dont know what other people are saying , but the software is awesome
very sturdy and strong
they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely ( as all of my pictures have thus far )
also , with one click you can help train your spam killer
the first one lasted about 6 years of heavy use
i got the diaper champ because of the great reviews as well as the fact that you can use regular garbage bags
i have no problems with the touch pad ( once the sensitivity is set to low ) and the interface is a breeze to use without even looking at the pdf manual
it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package
the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs , my entire collection of cd 's will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun
we have never had any problems with anything like loose wipes getting stuck ( we always wrap them in the dirty diaper )
3 band and you can just change the sim card in it to be able to use it in europe with another service provider
the ipod is a fine cousin to the early macs and current offerings from jobs and company
now that i own it , however , i can 't imagine being without it !
4 the build is just right
a sony erickson may be the phone for you but good luck finding one w all the features such a competitive price
only thing missing from creative is a cd burner
moving on to sound department it delivers !
hard drive screws up occasionally
no one has ever come to my house and noticed 'diaper odor '
this is extremely lame
i think the interface is great
got way too many blurry pictures
the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones
the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with canned air
the supplied headphones are hands down better than the mediocre ipod buds
but , i am quite unhappy with nokia at the moment
i highly recommend it
the only way my pc internet works is if i open the firewall program configuration and manually refresh it
on the downside , i think the interface takes some getting used to and the zen software !
all in all , trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing creepiness of this very embarassing gift
i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images
memory storage seemingly boundless
another plus in my book , no file limits !
this is my second digital camera , but i 'm much more impressed with the canon s100 digital elph than i ever was with my kodak dc240
of course , if you try to reach symantec customer service you get useless automated systems unless you want to pay 30 per incident
it comes with an adapter to plug into the wall , which i hear is a step up from the other ipods , which require you plug it into a computer to charge it
have not had any issues with the headphones or fragility
even the instruction booklet is out of order
the 2nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on
multimedia functions are enhanced by multi slide mms messages and a gallery for organizing digital content captured or downloaded with the phone
pros huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery
ooh , and i dropped it and it still works fine this little camera has so many features i have n 't even gotten to all of them yet
the headphone earbuds are average , so just use your regular pair instead
apparently , t mobile is heavily back logged and can 't keep up with demands
if you are looking for a phone to integrate as easily as the sonyericsson phones with isync , i say stick with a sonyericsson
the only beef that i have with it is that there is a little too much slop in the columns when the lock is not engaged
as it turns out , this is an awesome camera !
i registered for this item because of the good reviews it got , however i was not impressed
video recording is limited at just 9 seconds
the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well
it looks nice and sleek and the blue background light looks awesome against the black
i like the nomad 's color better , but it 's not terribly flashy
the actual experience of using the ipod is magnificent
so loud , really , that it does n 't work terribly well as a silent ringer option
it 'll make life a lot easier , and preclude you from having to give this product a negative review
having the digic ii chip helps a lot
if you currently own the 2003 version , and are looking to upgrade to the 2004 version , don 't
2 the scroll button is n 't the best , as it sometimes can be hard to select
there are extra features packed inside this unit ( some that most will hardly ever use ) such as fm radio tuner , voice recorder , calendar , and alarm clock
if you use software correctly , put in all the id3 tags , you will get an awesome database collection , from which you can easily access your songs
new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays
downside it takes a long time to start up
the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times
they have a good concept here , and i normally expect a lot better quality from creative , so maybe they will do better with the next gen version , but for now i say buyer beware
it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes
the software interface supplied was very easy to use but i went ahead and got red chair 's notmad software because of some advanced features i wanted
the nokia 660 runs the symbian os , which works pretty well for most standard phone fare , most of the stuff is not that intuitive , but if you actually learn how to use it all , there 's plenty of neat tie ins
this is a terrible company with a bad product and awful support
i want to start off saying that this camera is small for a reason
if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order
unit worked great for 3 weeks then video output failed
as i mentioned before , the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said , though notmad may still work better
it has a few inconveniences one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd
their network coverage is very sporadic , and the network always seems overloaded , resulting in very unpleasant calling experience
i have no problem using itunes with the zen micro ( in a makeshift sorta way )
i just uninstalled systemworks and internet security for at least the fifth time due to functionality issues
the fm tuner is just a little spare icing on the cake
i click pictures in jog format and because the phone has a bluetooth device i find it extremely easy to transfer pics to my pc and forth
the optical zoom is awesome , and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom
booting up my computer took forever ! ! !
i 've had this phone for almost a year now and it has been nothing but great to use
it looks sleek and modern
simple and it works !
i got about 700 loaded up before it told me i was full , and at that point , i was ready to toss it out the window
this program enables the user to batch convert and convert audio files from one format to another
give each friend a different ringtone
a lot of people complain about the creative software , but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes
it only read the dvds 10 of the time , otherwise i would get a no disc screen
i am so pleased with this product ! ! !
it fits into a hand well , it has a removable battery ( this is important ) , great sound quality , fm stereo , recorder , smooth ui , and a feature that most uni pods lack char !
all at the same time , and all without a hitch
just bought one i 've enjoyed it to date
only owned it about two weeks so i expect we 're looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon
we empty ours every day and we have never had an odors from it !
i really love this phone
oh , and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet
c i do love audio sync which allows a one click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer
do n 't buy this player
the card basically installed itself and the install wizard on the cd that came with the router basically set the router up to work with one computer ( with the 54g card ) and also a second computer in my house ( with an 11b card )
i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did
diaper champ is great
the sound is great , the portability , etc all the stuff you expect from a good mp 3 player , this zen micro has it
glad to see the ed revised the previous statements regarding image quality
battery compared to the other players on the market , the ipod has one of the worst batteries around
the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n 't have to reboot the computer or anything , just open up explorer again
the other annoyance with this that you have to remove every single remnant of previous version of norton systemworks before you installs this
so far , we 've only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine
great video clip quality for a digital camera so much better than my old one ( canon a60 ( ? ) the 2 0 megapixel one )
the combination of the price , storage size , and player features makes this player the best on the market
battery non issue
the collet for the 1 4 inch bits is a pain to get in and even harder to get out
i feel much less likely to drop this phone than others , which are actually starting to get too small
in other words , the zen is not a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1 for some sizing information )
creative did well on its rechargeable battery feature
5 ) bluetooth wireless technology , so that i can transfer data to and from my computer without messing with any cables
fortunately for me , i have yet to have a single problem with this player
not only is it much more cost effective ( you can use regular trash bags rather than refills at 5 a pop ) , it is easier to use and clean , and has a larger capacity
in summary , i love this camera and would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range
i imagine if i left my player untouched ( no backlight ) it could play for considerably more than 12 hours at a low volume level
1 the phone has the best keypad any nokia phone has to offer
the keys are close together , and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads , but it 's not too weird
but from my experience , by the time it gets to that point , the bag is really heavy , so i think this is kind of helpful it 's a built in way of keeping the bag manageable upon emptying
if you buying this player to use with napster to go , wait a while
when you turn on your player , the player turns on really fast , and the music continues to play , as you left it when you were turning it off
oh and file transfers are fast easy
great screen and great sound
whichever it may be , i 'm happy i 've made this purchase
it has great battery life , fm radio , excellent signal , hands free speakerphone ( which i have to say is probably my favorite function ) and downloadable java apps
i chose this one because from what i read , it was the best deal for the money
their customer ( www apex digital inc com ) service is very poor
but i had to give you four because the service for my brand new ipod was terribly slow
all and all , i am extremely pleased with this camera
this thing seriously is a good player though
i also own a canon digital rebel and i agree that the advanced controls on the sd500 are not as robust , but overall picture quality goes head to head with the digital rebel
however , the battery life is good enough you should n 't be overly concerned with turning this phone off
the player looks so much better when you 're actually holding it
scroll button more cumbersome than on earlier models
the screen is large and bright and has all the info i need where i need it
especially the bluetooth server meaning you have to restart the phone if you want bluetooth to work again
you must keep double checking depths
i got it to use with the new 5 per month service from yahoo ( music unlimited , ) and despite the above issues , i love it
while this phone obviously doesn 't have the same quality construction as motorola does , the nokia 6600 is one of the better phones i 've used
this is the best camera you can have for digital images if you want to
i have not yet used all the features , like the calendar , etc , but as a music player this little thing rocks
it 's so small and light , even with a spare battery , you really can take it anywhere
i am giving a zero star to symantec for this version !
the ringtones are beautiful , the screen is super high quality
the height is a more convenient reach than others , where you have to hunch over
however , i do n 't like to carry it on my belt because the clip is n 't secure and the case can slip off
the more i work with it , the more i love it !
no matter how accustomed to the phone you become , too much time is required to get to , open and close applications
yet after ensuring that all the id3 tags are in order ( with the software which is actually not as bad as people make it out ) it actually turns out to be really handy
the song quality of the ipod is excellent , and the included ear buds are actually more than satisfactory , for most users
had there been strange noises , or obvious defects , i would have accepted a replacement , but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches
customer service awful listen to this one , remember the battery statement i made earlier
the user support service isn 't too great either
it has given me zero problems , and the more i use it , the better i become at taking advantage of its strengths
negatives of the player itself you need to do a little work before having full enjoyment of this player
if i had to do it over again , even with the cost savings of using any type of bag , i would go w the diaper genie
it 's easy to transfer , preview , and organize files
you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( sound presets , navigating options , playlists , etc )
i don 't believe this camera is still available but if you can find one , you might like to get it
i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine
c ) the scroll bar is a travesty enough said
and so far , i have been very , very happy with my zen micro
it sends discontinuous signals to tv , so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment
no more banner ads , pop ups , and the reliable antivirus
operation it 's like bmw 's i drive it does it 's job , but has the most unintuitive , overly layered interface
5 ) its focusing system is also very flexible
overall the nikon 4300 is a very dependable , robust , and useful little camera
the headphones are n 't the best , but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity
now it will start smelling if you leave it with diapers in it for an extended period but all of them will !
i had a sony ericsson t610 before this and the t610 is far inferior
it 's a compact , attractive machine and was easy to set up
i gave up and got a diaper decor
2 ) phone is awfully slow
it does take some getting used to
the ipod mini is smaller and sexier , albeit limited in supported formats and the rio karma is a far better value
smooth plunging mechanism
as a whole , the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine
i did not conduct a rigorous test , but just took some identical shots in identical lighting with both cameras , and the canon won hands down
price , along with the replaceable battery ( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace as well as the hassle of returning it ) were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad
well i have to say that this product is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket
in terms of the shots taken , this camera is insanely great !
namely , it wouldnt sync
i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly , but there 's no difference in working with the files
purchased the ad 2600 about a month ago and have had numerous problems with it
enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n 't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem
2 ) storage capacity
great sound , very long battery life ( i routinely play it for 12 hours ) , very fast recharges rate , removable battery , storage size , nice screen , firmware updates , and great price
well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player ( at that size and the price )
not so nice things a bit too much weight and power for easy handheld use spindle lock makes for awkward bit changing ( outside of a table ) the 1 4 chuck sleeve requires much tightening to keep bits from slipping
some features in the user interface
technology wise , i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great ! ! ! ! i love this phone ! ! !
i tried called apex cu st service , no help
the wrt54g plus the hga7t is a perfect solution if you need wireless coverage in a wider area or for a hard walled house as was my case
i added a crank for those times when i need to make fine adjustments , but i seldom use it
pc cable is too expensive 50 for a usb cable ?
of course , i was hesitant given the price , but i 've been extremely impressed since receiving it , and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents
track , name , artist , album and genre is automatically retrieved via internet labeled , and properly categorized into the zen
they take excellent macro shots as well
i am able to carry it close to my body , in places where other phones are not so easily concealed
even did while daughter sleep and no noise !
so once i worked out the problem with the software this mp3 player is worth the money it cost
the keypad is a decent size , but the power on off key is small and difficult to press
we are overall pleased with product
first 4 months it was in our bedroom and we did not even smell any odor
1 ) frame freezes and the family yells , dad ! somethings wrong with the dvd player ! come quick !
i wanted standard memory expansion ( cf cards ) , macro mode , and if possible , a waterproof housing ( for kayaking )
this player seems to work fine with everything else
for looks , well ipod is head and shoulders better , both the iriver and creative zen look positively ugly when next to a gleaming ipod
i did n 't think i would find this quality and ease of use for under 1500 i 'm thrilled with my purchase !
after two weeks the picture kept freezing
we tried the finding memo dvd and when we got to chapter 28 , the frames started to freeze for no reason
overall , if you know what basic steps to take , it was not difficult to connect , and the s w worked well to connect
nokia was my first non flip phone , and i 'm glad i decided to go with them
their website had a download that helped remove those , although i had to manually remove a good number of files from the programs directory
my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature
they obviously have quality and reliability problems
i have never had an odor problem !
i have noted that as you use the tool , sawdust builds in the channel and it requires attention
i also did n 't like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode
i bought the diaper champ and have been very happy for the following reasons
norton support is completely pathetic
in addition , i do not think the battery lasts much more than eight to ten hours , and it can take four hours for a full charge
many of these programs are shareware , some can be purchased by paying a little bit of bucks
probably a great phone overall , and perhaps mine just has bugs
on the t mobile service i was able to take pics as we drove across i 70 and email them to family friends once we reached a t mobile tone ( usually a major city )
even the battery life is great it advertises 14 hours , it 's actually a little less but still good
in noisy environment , it 's hard to hear from the earpiece
i must say , i think this is the coolest camera i 've ever owned !
the battery life is amazing
although it has chubby hips , the device isn 't really so big
the g3 looks like a work of art !
the champ did not start letting a little odor through until well over a year
bluetooth does not work on this phone
the program brings more problems than a virus , albeit not as major problems , just not what you expect for 70 bucks
this makes for a great phone
there is absolutely nothing useful at the symantec norton site
smaller size , 1 gb of more space , radio , voice recording , removable battery , cooler look , all in one
i have been impressed with the power of the hitachi m12v
i am enjoying my phone a lot
but you can download some really good ones like pac man or mafia wars
also , it was only 39 99 ( after rebate ) with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player
ability to play most discs i tried dvd , vcd , dvd r , audio cd and it played all
also , for those that complain that the diaper champ isn 't as effective as time passes , keep the following in mind as babies get older , their diets changes ( aka solid foods ! ) and so does the smell of their diapers !
who knows how many uses you 'll get out of it before it craps out , but it probably will
this phone is not suitable for fast people , maybe only for old people
the only problem i had was a small glitch with t mobile
it is buggy , slow and basically frustrates the heck out of the user
i am very pleased so far
if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred , you will become frustrated quite quickly
the screen 's large and easily read
this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range , or like me , do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones
for the money , i 'm not sure you can do better
fm radio built in ( howard stern )
i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work
this router has soft start and runs smooth and true
1 pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance
seriously , this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want
i loved this product when i first got it great sound , easy to use ( even though i agree that the software was n 't the best ) and held enough songs to suit any mood
this camera was affordable , very easy to learn , and produces spectacular images
i felt better with this one since it had the shuffle feature and i 'm not too keen on www ipod 's dirty secret com
i hooked the linksys wireless router up to a broadband connection which is running at a maximum of 700 plus kilobytes on the download e !
you need the software to actually transfer files
all in all , this is the camera for you if you can spare the extra cost in price
all of the wireless components that i bought were a breeze to set up as well
i love all of the features , and presets as well
the base was deeper and the highs were crisper
it 's a rip off if one buys norton internet security and antivirus
lens cap is a really annoying
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset
why would anyone buy this when you can get a 20gb ipod that will hold 4 times the number of songs ( and even more if aac encoding is used ) for the same price ? ? ?
customer service and technical support are overloaded and non responsive tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them
overall it is the best camera on the market
i like the speak phone function a lot
i downloaded a trial version of computer associates ex firewall and antivirus and fell in love with a computer security system all over again
i would give it about 6 or 7 hours , although it will probably get better after a few charge cycles
you won 't need to update your firewall and antivirus separately or install two disks
in auto mode anyone can use it as a point and shoot camera
the touch controls took a little getting used to but now i wouldn 't change it for the scroll wheel
the battery lasts very long when playing music , but writing files to the player drains the battery fast , so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files
transfering mp3s are a cinch with the included software
i have transferred in about 2 , 400 tracks so far very easy to use both the ipod and itunes
wo n 't play a lot of discs
but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player , get the nomad
i only have one complaint , and that is the 8mb card included
i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied
i like the auto fit feature you can stretch wide screen dvd 's to normal
the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do
nice things about the m12v in a table , the powerful 3 1 4 hp motor is great soft start helps a lot to control the beast when you turn the router on continuously variable speed control amazon 's price
right out of the box , i loved it , better features than the ipod , great sound quality and no limitations on what music sources i can use
apple closed their island to anything that resembled microsoft , and clearly let napster know it could not use their products with napster 's services
but at least you re starting with the most photo realistic images ive ever seen from a camera
there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open ( my perv machine did it automatically ) , and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance
while i would like to give it 3 5 stars instead of 4 , i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it
after 10 years , i now downloaded mccaffee 's product after calling their support they answered quickly , and for free , and were very helpful
last , i find the price a bit expensive for a product such as this
i find this feature on this phone useless , but , since i don 't really need this function anyway , i don 't really use it
it offers way more features than i need but the ones i use work well
if you 'll only read the whole manual , you 'll find out even more cool features and you 'll learn how to manipulate the quality you want to achieve and all those modes will make sense after reading
i tried to contact apex to return it ( i missed the amazon return period ) and it took 3 months to get through to their customer service dept
the memory card fit nicely since i also have a pocket pc and it automatically installed a picture software on my pda willa
in low light with flash i found it clear better then the sony p200 ( too much red , colours overall not as natural but fewer red eyes )
it is so small that i am able to keep it in my pocket , and i don 't have to fear that it will get ruined in my pocket because it is so durable
this is the mp3 player with everything i need as long as it lasts me a good three years , i 'm satisfied
when you look through the viewfinder ( not the lcd ) the bottom left corner of the picture ( about 15 ) is blocked by the lens
it is slightly larger than an ipod , no doubt about it
i would imagine this is a problem with any camera of a compact nature
what makes the focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8
nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception
the battery issue is superficially a concern , but any reasonable solder jockey ( such as myself ) can pop in a new one when the time comes ( based upon the plentiful info gained from a go ogle for 'ipod battery replacement ' )
it did also seem to have a strong new electronics smell for some time
and best of all , no wasting money on special refill bags this takes ordinary garbage bags !
minor complaints 1 ) even though the music is sorted via id3 tag on the player , the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable
finally , making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually , and are organized by cd , which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order
no option for caller id pictures or individualized ringtones
even during the firmware updates my roommates did not loose wireless connectivity
record memos using the built in microphone
speed is not a problem
creative has put a lot of effort into making this player appeal to those true geeks that search for coolness and functionality in electronic devices
i am glad that i do not work for norton
fits well in hand in trouser pockets
to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player
i took my zen micro with me over the weekend , and was forced to lug my laptop with me on the trip for one reason to keep the zen micro charged
i tried to do this by instinct and it 's not intuitive unless you are a network geek
overall , i 've been very impressed with the player
i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i 've used before
the product has worked perfectly for me on my xp
i have ice age and it keeps telling me no disc
it does n 't smell like burning plastic when you open the drive
no problems now , just a sickly disappointment in the way norton has abandoned their customers
the buttons and interface are very easy to use
they have the worst service of any of the major companies
8 buttons are little , but if you have steady fingers and deal ed with a casio worst calculator watch , you can deal with almost anything
it came with a good fence that is simple yet precise and thats well made and won 't break
you can take pic of your friends and the picture will pop up when they call
given that i already have the zen the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software
i still can 't believe how fast it starts up
a bit disappoint on that !
the battery does not last 12 hours
once a depth is locked , it will jump off a little while working
when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there it is unbelievably small and oh , so light
original review december 2004 i 'm sorry to read about other people having problems with their zen micro , but mine has worked great !
the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used
the software is very easy to use , and the transfer is super fast !
better for the zen micro is outlook compatibility
i love the es based controls and easy menus
also , the fit and finish could be better although this doesn 't detract from performance
who in the hell needs a frigging vga camera on their cellphone ? ? ?
the flash is very weak
its quiet
all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well
the back of the ipod is in a chrome finish , and this surface is prone to scratches
i will never buy their product again at this rate , and neither should you
this is a really great buy , for yourself or as a shower gift
look at the size of it !
unfortunately , creative offered scant few pages of instruction , which meant that i was on own from the outset
the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone unlike the nokia 3650 and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make
loading cds was somewhat time consuming , but i think it would have been with the ipod as well
i 've connected the phone with two laptops and a ipa 4155
i did n 't abuse it , i charged it every day , but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out
i 'd say that this camera is perfect
anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception
first and foremost , it will take better pic 's than most film camera 's
i 've yet to find the limitation for this hitachi ( my only hitachi tool , by the way ) and quite frankly , i don 't know that i have the muscle to push this machine any harder
the bags attach inside the champ easily and all one has to do is cram the diaper down and flip the handle
the included fence guide is easy to set up and quite accurate as well
my brother had an old linksys b band wireless router in his home and it was like magic
as said before this works perfectly
i 've searched the program and their online tech support ( worthless ) and have found no solutions
do n 't buy this player
installation was as near automatic as can be
after attempting to navigate the clumsy touch pad system , i could not get the unit to download my wma files
you indefinitely appreciate the small size
by the way , i use the norton 2003 corporate at work with absolutely no trouble
6600 looks and feels nice
remote you can stand it on end ( harder to lose ) , and it 's far better designed than the 1100s
when i saw a high gain ( low price ) antenna was available to the wrt54g router , i thought i 'd happily give up some ( practically unattainable anyway , since you 've got to be in spitting distance from the router ) speed in favor of wider coverage
the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad
controls easy yo use and easy to get to
so far , the anti spam feature seems to be very good
the top did not fit well into the unit ( felt defective )
silver metal case not plastic
also the feature to automatically put in the song information is n 't always accurate
it is slow to initially start up , but once it 's turned on , i 've never had any complaints about the speed
each battery lasts about 10 11 hours
what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds
when i tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house , that one didn t work either !
6 ) the phone is really wide , which seems to be a turnoff for many people , but the phone is actually easier to grip and feel more ergonomic
the scroll wheel , to be blunt , sucks
images taken indoor were n 't so clear
i can 't tell you how many times i 've chipped a nail or hurt my fingertips because of the force needed to open it
the only thing i don 't like about it is that you have to buy a larger memory card , first thing !
all the good reviews for the sd500 are true
if you need a wireless router get it get it get it works really good
i got this camera about a month ago and i can 't put it down
it seems like the software is just not responding
using supplied s w , you can transfer all addresses from a different nokia phone into it
the micro has an impressive array of very nice features and a well designed user interface
the new drivers on cannon 's site do not help at all but try them if you want they have made me have to use the backup software
in minutes i was easily navigating through the menus
the battery has a long life
transfering is easy , the software makes everything pretty easy
i 've now had the camera for two months and i 'm even more pleased with it
compatibility with other devices is excellent too i 've only found one 11b device that won 't work with its mixed mode ( and it won 't work with anyone 's mixed mode )
a distinct ipod relation is evident with white colored cables , power plug and the very nice zen case with a white rubber inside covering
the battery is removable
nothing but hassle with this company
the battery life is very good , i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time , the first time around , and i have been using it with the lcd off every now and then , and have yet needed to recharge it
some people have commented about the size and weight of the phone , and it has rightfully gotten the nick name the bar of soap which , it really is
remote buttons are small and closely spaced , especially with the menu buttons
i had a lot of problems setting it up , since the software given along with it is buggy
when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n 't moving , the photos were awesome
great camera , and for the price you can 't beat it
i 'm sure i don 't use it to the degree of some of the other purchasers , but i really like it !
it does n 't have firewire , not a real complaint since most windows users do n 't generally have firewire cards themselves
the included memory card is too small
i like the automatic key lock function
light , compact design
comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit , included , is fast and small
imagine my disappointment , though , when the zen micro proved able to play only the mega strongest fm signals in my area
compared to musicmatch , the software has a better filing system and easier to use
another good feature is that you can charge the battery by just connecting the player to your computer using the usb cable
3 ) joy stick for eazy navigation , 35mb memory card to store the pictures and stuff
when i went to put in the new sd card i looked at the lcd screen cracked and the fluid gave a jackson pollock type appearance to the screen , black and blue and purple blotches and streaks useless
without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image !
the touch pad does take a little getting used to
the only thing i do n 't like about this is the cover does suck
a larger memory card and extra battery are good things to buy
whether you 're taking a brisk jog , waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park , you 'll be glad you had the fm radio
the os is ab it confusing at 1st , but within a few days you will pass this learning curve !
i am quite happy with the camera
having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos
this camera keeps on outfoxing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can 't be stopped
additionally , it has more fun stuff like more tones , wallpapers , screen saver , stop clock , alarm , java applications ( chess , currency converter etc )
basically , i ate the cost of the renewal and ate the cost of the tech help
the movie mode is also working great
well backlit keypad
the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi pro pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography
to install that version you have to uninstall from the window registery anything called symantec or nortron , also from the common files in the program folder the symantec folder has to be deleted
but the earbuds suck !
works great !
way to go apple !
i will never buy a creative product again
i don 't know what 's happened to norton , but 2004 is absolute garbage
) the zen micro appears sturdy and well constructed , hefty , if you will , far better than many of its competitors
i gave the zen 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 's not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class
the color screen is a plus , as are the polyphonic ringtones
don 't buy the diaper champ
all i have to say is that i did freeze on me once , but it has n 't done it since
this is the best dvd player i 've purchased
of course one of the first things i did was write an email to the customer support at creative , through their website , and by the time they finally got back to me several working days later when they promise only one their suggestions were completely worthless
and the tech writers have made the installation process so easy for people lick my aunt to follow
this camera is so easy to use !
first , the battery is replacable by the user , because creative intended it to be unlike apple with the ipod
the box proudly displays securest ( tm ) wireless made simple one touch setup button easy start easy security easy everyday apparently linksys cisco knows that ease of setup is crucial
it is very light weight and has a good signal strength
the same 4mp chip from the 4500 camera , plus a 3x zoom with the ability to expand upon that with extenders , great closeup mode , long lasting rechargable battery , etc etc
great product , easy to use , economical , effective , absolutly fabulous
i still like it a lot and am not changing it for another , but it is sort of stinky
great price
is not as intuitive as i would like
yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion ( i do n 't like it too but no harm done since i always use the cam ea lcd screen to see exactly what i 'm going to get ) in the viewfinder when you do n 't zoom ( when you zoom the lens distortion goes away ) , canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon that is what lamest exactly ot the picture
fyi , battery doesn 't die if you don 't use lcd
my ipod freezes occasionally , which is especially annoying when you 're in the middle of a game of brick
so much packed in a small case and very affordable !
the sound is very nice
however , the calls constantly drop in my area and i experience mega static , to the point where i 'd have to dial numbers 6 7 times to get a clear line
overall small , sounds great , and less expensive than apple 's overpriced ipod !
the diaper champ turns the smelly diaper into what diaper smell in less time than that
this is easy to work and easy to dispose of the dirty diapers
also , the instruction manual is very bad
the hitachi is made in malaya , and looked cheap compared with the makita , which is made in the usa
i have ripped over 100 songs from my cd collection and it was so easy and fast , and they all sound great
b fast mediasource cd ripping takes about 40 seconds for a cd on my pentium 4 pc ( 2 4 hz with 1gb ram ) with 52x drive
there were no other obvious setup instructions though there was a soft copy manual , it did not give an answer readily on what do to
overall the phones fantastic , and i would have given it 5 stars , but its not perfect
they play just about everything , but 2 and 3 died very shortly after getting them
the player feels very delicate , as if i 'm holding an actual hard drive
best of all the wmas ( i have a lot of them ) sound great
settings for just about everything , beautiful pics and beautiful prints
very good every day camera fits nicely in the pocket of my jeans and takes quality photos
i think , apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price
no offense to amazon , but i was able to find one online for just over 200 bucks ( i 'm sure prices here will continue to sink ) , and that also seemed quite a good bargain for the amount of storage space
otherwise , this player is awesome !
you hit the message button on the front and it takes a matter of seconds to bring up the menu
two , the single wrench just doesn 't work well
the battery life leaves a lot to be desired
the nokia 6600 is a decent extension of the smart phone line
uploading music is quick and easy
believe me when i say this i have used and fingered all nokia phones and the 6600 has the best keypad
the zen does n 't support folders so it is not really a storage device even with third party software that creates folders , documents and programs can 't be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it 's a storage device at best
the karma doesn 't look as sexy but it 's interface is very efficiently designed
great quality picture and features
the eax features are pretty cool , as well , as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that , for example , compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train
aside from a 6mb built in phone memory , there 's a 32mb mmc card that goes with it !
speaking of battery , it 's removable and replaceable !
sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference
also , you can store data on it , which is a plus for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod , do n 't bother , this is a much better buy
there are 2 things that need fixing first is the battery life it will run for 6 hrs without problems with medium usage of the buttons
turn the camera on while pressing the button ( or is it the menu button ? i have to check again ) ) and it 'l show you the time and date
there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient
im a more happier person after discovering the i p button !
then , my ad pop up blocking was completely gone
3 ) the lack of an intermediate resolution setting , as other reviewers have suggested , is a problem , but that problem is meaningless with a larger compactflash memory card
it does well in all aspects of internet browsing
two it has a removeable rechargeable battery , so you don 't have to send the thing in when the re !
however after just one month my headphone jack was broken as a result of normal , every day use
also , the nomad 's 14 hours of battery life versus 8 is handy
i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now , and i am very happy with it
i no longer use it as a plunge router , only as a stationary or table mounted router
i see many other reviews that say the same stay away from norton , they don 't deserve you , or anyone !
i occasionally flip songs while working out as i accidently hit the pad even lightly ( yes i have it in maximum desensitized mode )
saw the hitachi on amazon com with their 25 00 coupon ( at the time ) and could not resist trying it out
i purchased two of these beauties
if you think you are saving 40 getting the hitachi , you are right , and you are also getting a router worth 40 less than a makita
if this machine just stops on you , unplug it quickly and get out of the way !
00 good though , and the zen does have a few drawbacks
the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did n 't notice after first day
i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts , and both were bad
the scroll bar problems make the task of creating playlists more frustrating
i love this product !
very simple to use
this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks
the touchpad is annoying sometimes ( give me the click wheel and pres sable buttons any day ) , but not at all as difficult to get over as other people are saying
battery life is good for a phone of this size
when it came down to it , the price on this player is hard to beat
since zen does not have an external antenna it has some problems catching weak signals but it works
i was a little disappointed in the low end
the sound quality is excellent and the speaker phone couldn 't be easier to use
i highly recommend a nokia 6610
as i wrote , this could have been a great product , but expect hidden charges ( read gross profiteering and price gouging ) as the company royally sticks you on every conceivable accessory necessary for normal daily usage
unfortunately , the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming
the small size is perfect for my little hands , but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person
it 's perfect for those who aren 't planning on storing tons of music
solid , squeak free , large screen
my jpeg pictures are viewable ( not so sharp and vivid ) on my 27 screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17 monitor
it is amazingly small , it 's hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera
software definitely sucks , hangs up my notebook about half the time , but i do n 't mind buying notmad
there is no fm tuner , while there is no fm tuner on the creative zen ( on the micro version of the zen there is a tuner ) , the iriver h10 20gb , the rio karma , and the audio x5 have fm tuners
this phone is a winner
using the software itunes is relatively simple , you just plug the usb cable in , wait your machine to detect the ipod and voila , any songs listed in your itunes library will be transfer ed on over to the ipod
i have noticed an odor ( one the i expected ! ) when unloading the diaper champ but at least you don 't smell anything every time you use it
i can 't rate it one star only because when it does work it 's pretty good
it sits in the corner of our bathroom and we have never had any problems with odors at all ( and we live in the damp and humid south , where odors of all kinds are generally rife )
within one month , my player completely died
features really , there aren 't any features , unless you call the games a feature
i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer !
fact is , it could n 't be easier to use
i bought my zen micro three months ago mainly because i preferred the size and style to the ipod mini
the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there
usb 2 0 very fast
does not recognize player at random times , despite being connected and displaying player 's library
i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but on full size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive
has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range
after upgrading the drivers and firmware a few times and e mailing tech support for some setting tips it now works fine
however , its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70 of the shots that i take
on the positive side , the sound of the player is pretty good , once you have everything configured
we also had a problem with diaper wipes getting caught when the top was flipped
unarguably better than apple 's , and nice earbuds to boot
only thing i don 't like about it is slow in changing apps , boot up , and sometime it has problem connect thru bluetooth
battery a big big plus
the zen micro is no exception in addition to the case , it comes with a neck strap , and has all of the necessary cables for syncing and charging
i actually purchased two phones recently ( this one at the new blackberry phone ) , and this one is far superior ( imho )
this camera is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer
1 ) a spare battery would have been great
i love the continuous shot mode , which allows you to take up to 16 pix in rapid succession great for action shots
also , you have to use it with itunes or they 'll sue , dammit ! but itunes is about as good as anything
this router acts as a wireless access point , 100 mb switch and a router making it a nice multipurpose device
like it 's predecessor , the quickly revised nx , this player boasts a decent size and weight , a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags , and excellent sound ( widely known to be better than ipod not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business )
well the champ has survived it 's first year with our son and it is great ! !
i had to return the remote on this product because it appeared to be defective
so i can 't tell you if diaper champ will be as good at containing the formula generated poop smell , but it 's excellent at containing the smell of poop of my breastfed baby !
the manual modes give you a lot of control over exposure and white balance ( but there is no manual focus or manual exposure )
i use it in the table ( never take the springs out just attach the fine adjustment knob ) , in my woo drat and freehand and it works great in all circumstances
and it fits right in my pocket much easier than my old s30
among my requirements for a phone were good screen , decent camera , bluetooth , and gprs support
and also , it 's priced very afford ably
but about 25 of dvd 's i 've played on it have a problem , when watching a movie the picture will freeze , but the dvd still plays , and eventually the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments
we have been using our diaper champ for almost 14 months now and we are very happy with it
first , the player did not allow me to access the menus of dvds
we bought this about 6 months ago and it 's been worthless
1 no direct firewire to the camera
i decided to go with the diaper champ rather than the more popular diaper genie , because i didn 't like the idea of having to buy special bags
everything i wanted ! the apple ipod has become one of the most sought after electronic gadgets and for good reason
all in all this a great player that blows the i pod away , with easy to use and understand features , software that is simple to understand and use , and a great sound ( which is all that matters in a mp3 player )
in conclusion , this player is beautiful
software is easy to use ( although red hat software is better , but costs money )
excellent diaper disposal unit
there are better cameras but none anywhere near as light and compact
one neat thing i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms no problem for the camera rooms looked like they had ample lighting
i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing
for the price , it 's a very nice dvd player
it 's far better than all others on the market
first , it serious , serious installation problems
for a price that 's still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster , and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some
the macro mode works well , although it takes some practice since the camera doesn 't clearly indicate when it can 't focus
sunset feature takes incredible pics in the morning , and the evening !
i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual
the guide fence for freehand routing is well made and solid
applications it has lots of applications and they work very well when you eventually find where they are and they finally open
the 4300 is a very durable , compact package , and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust
i am just in love with this phone , especially after using a more primitive phone about 3 years
can 't beat carrying 500 cd collection with me wherever i go
3660 had similar features , but that is big in size
the setup works awesome , as with any tool i look closely at the individual tool for it 's merits , and not just the company as a whole
unfortunately i was wrong
also , i am quite partial to the creative mediasource organizer and player software , which i had with audigy zs sound card originally it is definitely an added plus
you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call
the software is quick easy to use i found the entire process very easily mastered
i am an it professional and have used norton for years , but this product is a complete and utter dud
i bought it for my trip to buns aries , and also used it at the iguassu falls , and could not have asked for more perfect performance !
once again it won 't reinstall , even with online and email assistance from symantect technicians
yeah i agree the earbuds are pretty crap , replace them
because of this , i am disappointed and would not recommend this product
i do n 't always care for gracenotes ' genre listings but it allows easy editing of id3 tags
the handsfree provided by the phone is useful for those who talk on the phone while driving
apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players
i 've had this player for more than 4 months and i 'm very happy with it
the more i use it and figure out how to do things , the more i like it
it it is a bit heavy for hand held work , but any router this size will be
don 't care about sunlight it 's tft
it has a classic design yet looks hip
sometimes , various applications crash
this is enough capacity and capability to do a complete household inventory , for example
the i pod is the best thing i have ever used
the price performance looked just right
i had much of the same problems that everyone else has listed ( mainly the slow processor ) , and then i couldn 't get the damn thing off my computer completely !
the software , which comes with player is not good at all
it is lightweight , sleek and attractive
i was impressed by this very inexpensive player for the first three hours , and then it died
broadband hooked up to this wireless setup flies
first , it really is tiny the size of a pack of cigarettes , maybe a scotch deeper
value comparing data storage with price
the player works well with my sony srs a 202 powered speakers
the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures
the wrt54g offers excellent security features and much more ( and easier ) configuration menu that i didn 't even need a manual to setup correctly
itunes can be downloaded from the enclosed cd or for free from the apple site
we 've never experienced odor from the pail
it was a symantec error
if there were any complaints i have , they are marginal , but one is apples ' proprietary set up for music files , their incompatibility with other music services ( i e napster ) is down right wrong
it 's easy to use , and yet very feature rich
my fast forward button works , but it takes a little extra pressure on it to make it go
its compact and has rounded edges
also as someone who at least knows a little bit about the technical work of taking a photo i really miss having manual controls
it fits comfortably in my shirt pocket and while very well designed , doesn 't look to ostentatious while i 'm walking around with it
i find the major problem with this item is that if you have a very messy diaper and can 't tightly bundle it without a mess , the mess gets all over the module that dumps the diaper and the stink is outside of the diaper pail
the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging
in fact , it supports the new wpa encryption standard , which is way better than wep
canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out
i 've had it for about a week now and have to say it 's one of the best purchases i 've ever made
i 'm staying with sprint , and though i fear that their csr is n 't nearly as good as t mobile 's , the clarity of their reception is exceptional
huge storage space , i loaded my entire collection of music , which isnt that much , 400 songs , and still have 26 gb , out of the 28 provided to you
this is a great deal , and i 'm elated with my decision to go with hitachi 's green machine
the panorama setting is unbelievable !
so , right out of the box i had issue
there is little meaningful difference between the two versions aside from the tedious activation process , and the product is currently rather buggy and has problems running unless cleanly installed on a formatted drive
the outlook syn ch only works for non recurring appointments , which personally is very annoying to me but probably wont be to most people
replacement battery is 50 compared to ipod 's 150
the viewfinder does not accurately represent the picture being taken
i have a tendency to do quite a bit of research before i drop money on a tool and everyone i talked to loved this router
( every now and then i spray down the inside of the pail with lysol ) easy one hand use impossible for my inquisitive child to get the dirty diapers out of the pail every now and then odors do escape the pail , but that is rare and it usually just means that we 've crammed too much in there and need to change the bag
firewire usb2 0 for those fortunate enough to have firewire400 , your in for a real treat with auto sync
the buttons are easy to use , and its easy to navigate
all the buttons necessary lil ' gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand
love the speaker phone
a lot of people are having problems with the firmware update required to use the player for napster to go the firmware is beta and they are are a lot of bugs in it
likewise , i 've heard norton 2004 professional version is fine too
friends told me that the diaper genie did not work very well , so bought the diaper champ based on on line reviews and i have been happy with it
playlists can be generated on the fly ( which is a bit clunky but still a really nice bonus ) or by using the software , and there are a bevy of eq options
the software was great , as long as you have an administrative user account ( windows xp )
i had the second one for less than two weeks when i noticed a rattling humming buzzing sound while music was played
the software runs smooth , it 's nice to look at , it 's very organized , easy to follow and makes things very simple
it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly
i purchased this over the ipod mini because it had several nice features extra 1g storage , wma support , replaceable battery , and especially that it wasn 't an apple product with their proprietary architecture
i didn 't have any major problems installing this software
it seemed as if we were emoting the pail everyday and it was in no way odorless
i 'd give it 4 5 stars if possible , but since 5 stars would be misleading , i give it 4 stars
i have had the ipod mini and it performs on the level with my sound card but the micro beats it outright
i also removed the springs in the plunge tubes to make it easier to raise
ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings , there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring
the soft start is a tremendous help for this type of operation
so i e mailed the online tech support with that simple question , and got a reply which was totally unresponsive ( it looked as though they didn 't actually read the e mail and just sent back a few boilerplate paragraphs )
nokia makes a great phone , that 's clear
2 ) the player user interface ( ui ) is intuitive to use , and allows easy navigation of a large or small collection
best phone i 've ever owned , period
nice palm sized unit , somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you 're not going to try jog with it or something
the price compared to the ipod is great
i had no problems following their installation instructions
however , my hard drive did fail , and i have not dropped it once
this product is way cooler than anything ive used before ( pencilings and maccabees and norton antivirus alone )
still has terrible software
speakerphone loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch
it has a cardboard slip cover with a nice layered box casing inside
bought the 30gb xtra a couple of weeks ago , and so far it has been excellent
i tried it again this morning and it said i didn 't have the required permissions and lacked proper administrator status
one caveat i have is that i understand the ipod does not save the photos in such a way that the quality of the image is preserved
if someone asked me flat out , i 'd say to go woth something else
also , the earbuds that came with it sound great but are uncomfortable ( although my wife didn 't have a problem ) , so i bought a pair of over the ear headphones
i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have n 't had any problems
once installed , however , some of the functions do work ok ( disk doctor , one button checkup , and win doctor )
navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer ( and vice verse ) was easy too
you can upgrade but then there 's a certain level of trouble involved
1 the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post processing flexibility
1 ) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its program and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n 't want to bother with the settings
it is easy to install and change the ordinary trash bags , easy to clean , and most important , easy to use one handed just insert folded dirty diaper and flip the handle
i love the features , the interface , the size ( the screen is a delight ) , the camera ( though i admit i 'm not much of a camera user so just a toy for me ) , the internet connectivity , the quality , etc
the new organizer software that ships with the nomad zen xtra could n 't be easier to use
if the plunging action is critical to your work , look elsewhere
although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department , it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do to be a wireless telephone
there is no way you can talk with customer care about this
after using it for about a month , i can state unequivocally that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck
the touch pad is over sensitive , and is adjustable to only slightly oversensitive
the 4g ipod costs the same as this 5g zen micro
the accessories that come with the player are great
the hitachi m12v is a dream to work with , smooth starts , adjustable speeds , micro adjustable depth , and plenty of power to spare
for a sleeker , smaller and more average mp3 player the nitrus is great but the ipod blows it out of the water the interface is great and the design is wonderful
it is small
durability not good first problem , if you haven 't seen the news recently , the ipods are being recalled for battery problems and not lasting the advertised 18 months
it seems like you need to park yourself right next to a radio tower for the micro to pull in a strong sound
also i like the position of all the controls and the fact that it doesn 't have any extra knobs or gizmo 's
it also lets you remove songs from the play order
in general it is easy to use and well laid out
i 've tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio , but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment
i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it
i almost always get a good strong signal , even in fairly remote areas here in the southwest
cons breaks easily
i can only hear the sound but no picture !
i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again
b ) the lens cover is surely loose , i already accidently finger printed the len a few times , and au lens ti gt and cause potential damage
the headphones which came with it are mediocre at best but what can you expect from a set of ear buds
for last one month my rebate status showing me that my rebate is approved and check is delivered but still i am waiting for check
with this mp3 player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod
i am impressed with this camera inside and out
the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to
i loved it until it broke , but less than a month is not an acceptable period of time for something to work
t mobile was a pretty good server
but this doesn 't make up for it 's innumerable other short comings , the biggest of which is the inability to download any updates due to problems with liveupdate
all in all , this is a great phone
this item broke just two weeks after i gave it to my kids for christmas
user interface the software is simple and straight forward
i would have liked to have given it 4 1 2 stars docking that 1 2 star only for the size
and it holds so much music and audio files
i 've had no problems at all so far and i 'm very happy
all you have to do is click one button on the router configuration window and the router automatically senses the devices and configures the network
i downloaded the new firmware which was supposed to take care of the problem , but it hasn 't worked
just want a wireless router for home or your very small business , you can just get a wrt54g from here and configure it
this is truly a clydesdale among the industry 3hp router workhorses
overall , a very disappointing product
the quality is significant and you 'll be very happy from saving time and the headache
overall , the micro is a solid device and i haven 't fell into a problem with it yet knocks on wood
dont rely on t mobile rebates
the mobile text messaging , chat , picture sharing etc other niceties , that you would enjoy
3 ) with mediasource being so easy , i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software
the other controls are all very easy to use
the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on , 60 percent of the time , it sis , shutting down , which means i have to turn off , and turn it on again , which is not to my likings
it did play a dvd r which was unplayable in my older philips machine
the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product
5 the zen does not have a stop button !
but my biggest gripe is still the extremely ugly design
i have not played with all the features yet , but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it
the service from the supplier was exceptional
looks ok very shiny chrome and mirrors
but it comes with a tank of a case and if you cut a piece out where the screen is you can always keep it in the case and still access everything
7 mediasource did not install on my personal notebook
otherwise , i am extremely please with the creative zen micro 5gb mp3 player
its sleek design , large memory capacity , compatibility with itunes , and ease of use makes this one of the best portable digital listening devices on the market
this camera takes amazing pictures and its size can not be beat
great design very sleek and touch wheel has still never been successfully copied ( virtual ones are the only competition ) and now the wheel clicks , taking away a lot of headaches from 3rd gen and very navigable in the menus
the bass treble the sound detail is aw some
i finally got a free support number for norton through my usp support staff , but waited an hour or more for a voice
the build quality shows why its so cheap small scratches on the base plate , something that you would n 't see on a sony and an overall plastic feel
the sound is amazing
it has great incredibility
2 take around 10 , 000 640x480 pictures
i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first class digital camera at a reasonable price there is no better camera out there period !
1 i achieved my basic objective my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more
3 ) joy stick for eazy navigation , 35mb memory card to store the pictures and stuff
just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has
overall i like the unit
the view finder shows crystal clear pictures that will look even better when you get them to the computer
the only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality longevity of the buttons on the thing
the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i 've ever had
the last problem i found with this camera was the macro function
5 ) this apex model 2600 will not work with my universal remote control
but , sometimes , if the champ is too full , the flip handle won 't function
the touch buttons do take a little getting used to and i don 't like how the scroll button is the same button used as an enter key , but you get used to it and it isn 't a big deal
i simply hate symantec i swear , if i could have physically ripped that software out of my computer with my bare , bleeding hands , i would have
so i took out the battery and put it back in again , only to find that it would not work
i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement
they will not respond to my emails ( promised turnaround time is 24 hours ) and the phone line is constantly busy
there are no spec ail bags to deal with or buy !
there is also no voice recording , something most if not all mp3 players have that the ipod doesn 't
i have had no problem what so ever with this product
i have read the installation instructions for both nis 2004 and navy 2004 prior to installation , but still ended up with the same result junk software
among its weak points is the mmc slot location and a bit vague design
4 looks great
reset the network , tried the connection , and it 's working like a charm
the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy
it 's really a shame , because otherwise , creative mp3 players are very good , and have the best sound quality of any players on the market
but the product is elf is great
1 record around 1 hour of video with phillips camcorder pro
the movie mode can only record a max of 30 seconds at 160x120 per clip and a max of 4 seconds at 640x480
you can disable some of the individual components , but don 't be fooled they 're still there and running
so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance , also anyone who wants a hard drive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing
typically , the problem is the headphone jack it was for me and many others
excellent range of metering options as well
i was willing to live with the larger size ( inconvenient on the road ) but the durability was a big zero
after a recent update , i can no longer open more then 1 browser window
this product sucks , the customer service from apex sucks
it is n 't big and offensive , though you would n 't know it by looking at the pics it takes
took me a few tries to get use to the navigation , but it 's a very user friendly player imo
the hard case they give with it must work well
this is not a router i would suggest for a novice user , my old dlink di52 !
this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used
i 've since gotten the linksys modem ( befcmu10 ) and stacked it with the wrt54g router and it works fantastic ! ! !
this is a great product !
sure it had all the features , but when i tried to shoot a girl 's basketball game it just wan 't up to the task
after installation , the very first time i booted up the creative mediasource organizer , intending to use its cd burning and ripping functions , it totally shorted out
some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to
the catch is it 's built like a piece of crap
please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod
i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra 40gb and it is fantastic !
who wants to go through the hassles of loading software onto a foreign computer just to move over some simple ( txt ) files ?
output through component connections looks very good , on my non hd tv
it has an equalizer , but the iriver h10 20gb has a lot more presets than the ipod
other than that it meets or surpasses all of my needs and surely won 't disappoint any already established nokia phone fans
the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out !
audio on video also lacking
but not good enough for me
it 's shorter , sleeker , more compact and fits comfortably in my small hand than the ipod my nokia cell phone towers over this bad boy !
i dont use the belt clip cz it fails to hold the player securely ( design problem )
the thing has survived plenty of falls with little or no damage , except the inevitable scratches
it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device
contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1 250 of a second with third party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon
this is a benefit for many reasons one being just for appearance , your pants wo n 't be bulging with this phone in your pocket
the touchpad is great once you get used to it , and i much prefer it to standard buttons or scroll wheels ( as on the dell dj for example )
the only complaint i have is that the 1 4 collet will not sufficiently hold any of my 1 4 bits
it 's easy to use , and makes transfering your cd collection to the player a cinch
no memory stick slots although a rare feature , it would be nice to have extra storage , not that it needs it built in lithium battery a huge hassle to bring this back draining the battery once you get it helps , but removable replaceable ones are a lot more convenient
this doesn 't affect standard mp3 files just subscription wma files
one more thing , the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible
after repeal cleaning and re cleaning , it still stuck after using it for a little while
transferring music is a breeze i don 't subscribe to music services , but as mentioned on other reviews , micro allows you to subscribe to services other than itunes
and so far , i 've been very pleased
i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size , speakerphone option , great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email
if you have to buy a camera on a bu get , this has got to be the one
what i like the most small and solid feel
while i was trying to play half life 2 it started popping up with alerts every twenty seconds ( literally ) , warning me my antivirus protection was off
the software has been installed on windows 95 , 98 , 2000 and xp and i haven 't had any problems with it
the pop up blocker and anti spam are bonuses
if you are looking for a user friendly diaper pail that actually does keep the odor contained , than the diaper champ is the one for you !
i upgraded from a very small 3 2 max camera to this camera with great results
it holds a lot of diapers , not to mention the odor !
you don 't need to cough up an extra couple bucks for a special edition to get black ! sound awesome ! batteries removable replaceable
controls are a bit awkward
the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain
will never purchase apex again
the latest of internet security has antispam function that is helpful because i has received a mountain of those these days
another great feature for me anyway is the ability to load wav sounds as ringers
creative was defiantly giving the ipod a run for their money with this device
also , very light and portable
i mean , they 're short !
but for what i do use it is perfect
i love my dark blue zen micro and would definitely recommend it
it can be frustrating and messy when you put that last diaper in before realizing the unit is full
and the phone has a very cool feature which allows you to send images via a normal pop3 smtp e mail account
the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night , but dim enough so it does n 't blind you when you stare too long
the color and light i captured with this camera on a 12 day trip to turkey ( gorgeous vividly colored ceramic tiles inside darkened mosques ) were far superior to anything i 've ever gotten with a traditional 35 mm film camera
the phone is sturdy
i 've had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose
while i 'm not too keen on their customer service ( none of the products i have from creative have given me issues ) , i can definitely recommend the zen micro for the simple fact that it does exactly what it is supposed to do and more without needing any of the extra hype except word of mouth
software the software that comes along with it is not very intuitive but once you are used to it , it does the job well
1 pictures wo n 't transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable
otherwise , this is a great alternative mp3 player for those of use who don 't want to worship the mighty all powerful apple
included creative software is pretty poor
one of my favorite features about the player is its ability to sync to windows media player
the downside being that the tito can only connect at 802 11b speeds and not 802 11g
my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons
i will also say that setting up the e mail account was very simple and straight forward , although you do need an external smut server to use
it powers up quickly , so you won 't miss that quick shot
1 creative mediasource software is ok to rip , catalog burn music if you are starting from scratch but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen ( 278 cds 3 , 400 tracks 12 5 gb of music all ripped at 128bps ) and guess what ?
but now that she is eating solids the odor is escaping out and we are constantly using freshener
also , i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and br mp3 cds ( my old apex ad 1200 had trouble with these )
i 've since replaced it with a pair of black sennheisers not only are the packaged earbuds pretty uncomfortable , but are too similar to ipod 's and can target ipod thieves here in nyc
main dial is not backlit
excellent sound i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox
the software could n 't be better and the mp3 player works like a dream , i could n 't give this anything but a 5 , i wish there was a 6
holy cow ! it really does scratch easily !
this product is absolutely not ready for release
essentially , the cd included with the package is , for the most part , worthless
it plays original dvds and cds and plays mp3s and jpegs
with my sennheiser 497 headphones , the volume is loud enough at 12 ( max is 20 )
i have had this player for 3 months and have been able to see a total of 6 dvd 's , after the frustration and aggravation of getting the player to do it 's job
i tried the cd setup program without any luck
i tell you now , after lot of shooting in many different situations , this camera is amazing
i have had no problems with the phone
neither message was answered ( they ask for 24 hours before replying i 've been waiting 27 days )
an extra gig of room , fm radio , voice recorder , pim applications with sync to outlook
it would only transfer 30 or so songs , and then come up with an error
both the on off switch ( soft start ) and the depth lock are within easy reach of the right hand
the sound from the player is ok
i can go pretty far away from my router and still connect wirelessly
only 1 problem , no accessories yet
everything shines of quality
it 's cheaper , holds more songs and is smaller
with all its complicated features , the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great
the battery holds a charge for a very long time ( maybe 15 or so hours of use ) so realistically there are no real range or endurance issues associated with ipod use
other than that , this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips
i first used the router in the free hand mode and liked it a lot
with 40gb of storage i have about 7 , 500 songs on the player ( everything music file i have is on there ) with room for about 2 , 500 more
it was easy enough to remove the front plate , and there was only one way the battery could be inserted
manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding
i 've dropped the device several times onto hard surfaces , and it still works flawlessly
i also put a bend in the wrench so i can remove and install bits from the top of the table
now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 !
it 's very solidly built , and has a nice dense feel to it
if you can get one with all the accessories and a cheap extended warranty , this is the player to get ! highly recommended
first , i have to say that i have never had the slightest problem with this camera or the software
ultimately you will learn just how bad nokia is , and why their recent loss of market share is so utterly deserved
less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows no disc
the internet functions of the phone wap and gprs will only work through t mobile 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network
audio is excellent
this phone is fantastic
so now it still plays everything , you just can 't see it !
overall , i highly recommend this phone
the function lever the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile
3 ) user replaceable battery
everything else about the camera is great
it has the odd side effect of the buttons only partially working ?
the camera has a wonderful set of features
slick looking design and improved interface
this camera is so light and tiny that i literally carry it everywhere with me , which is great considering i 'm an artist and like to capture interesting items for future painting
i do not count this as a negative , however , because it is not that much of a nuisance and at the price for what you get this router is way too good to pass up ! ! !
there was neither picture nor sound
however , in my mind , 299 is a lot to pay for a device that will only last 18 months
the ipod comes formatted for the mac , but within seconds of plugging it into a pc , is automatically reformatted for windows ( the hp version comes with windows formatting , and takes seconds to change to mac ) although the ipod can be changed from one format to another , you will lose all of your music and data when doing so
you can also slow a song down speed it up , which is cool too
the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone , and what a great phone it is
the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly
i 've had this camera just over 2 years and it takes pretty good pictures
now i know why they are pieces of junk
the ms scandisk would appear due to manual shutdown and would only scan to the 2nd bar , over and over ( up to 1 hr , i then shut it down and used go back )
the eax sound enhancement feature did n 't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq
in all fairness , customer reps are very nice , and they ( most of them ) try hard to answer your questions
still , i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features !
the battery is also convenient , but could have been better , such as the zen touch 's battery ( but at least this one is removable )
10 ) multiple play modes tracks in order of album , shuffle , etc , is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter
sound quality excellent , everything you would expect from this company
the internet connection would go down every 5 mins when i used it with a p2p program called bit spirit
however , it has failed to deliver on quality
it is no more heavy than any other powerful router and not as bad as some porter cable models i tried
it 's great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen
the service from t mobile is very good too
this player is absolutely phenomenal , i haven 't had any problems , and if you 're worried you will have problems , i suggest buying it at a retail store that has a good return policy but anyways i find the touch pad very easy to use , and i 'm surprised so many people have had problems
it 's a bit pricey to call home from other countries but the instant messaging to and from covered countries in europe are quite reasonable
it is heavy enough to make it stable , but not too heavy to preclude hand use
by the way , it looks nice also
you also need to go in and manually remove many symantec files from the registry
3 4 way through the first disk we played on it ( naturally on 31 days after purchase ) the dvd player froze
the music is easy to get to ( all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with the zen
the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it ( jpeg , kodak pic 's and dvd r ) i have read other reviews and some good and so om not so good , but my feeling at this time is two thumbs up !
one beef is the scroll , it does n 't work as well as i 'd like
the product also leaves a faint smell in the room
i was having intermittent problems with it losing connection
the general button placement is not very user friendly
removable battery
i have n 't messed with the firmware at all , the player worked perfect for me right out of the box
the battery on mine lasts 2 days if i don 't play games that much , and it only takes 90 mins to charge from flat
so , don 't buy this or upgrade
overall , it 'll make my move that much easier knowing i don 't have to worry about connectivity
pros the design is very nice , and the colors are too
this camera is perfect for the person who wants a compact camera that produces excellent photos in just about any situation
although , i thought it could 've been designed a bit better
neat feature for self timer allows you to record two different warnings
it had a heavier and more sturdy casing
i 'm really happy with this purchase
this player is fantastic in terms of audio quality , ease of use , and features
the sound quality is excellent ( and i 'm fussy with that stuff ) , the unit looks cool , screen is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod ( besides the price , but everyone knows that )
i 've had almost no problems with the firmware ( ie , lock ups , shut downs etc ) , but i have kept the player up to date
the nokia 6600 is a great phone , good games , good camera
i love the features on the ipod and the many things you can do with it
i like to take pictures when i go out at night and perhaps some people would complain that noise levels are high at higher iso 's but i don 't really care that much , i think it gives the pictures a certain real life quality
cranking the master volume level up past the mark of the bar only leads to distortion and compromised sound quality
it holds plenty of songs
the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected
the ease of use of the ipod is a major attribute
the color screen makes this free after rebates phone shine bright , and commands are very responsive
since i received the phone , i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised t zones would work in 24 hours
the menus are very easy to navigate
i try navigating using the player 's built in menu , and it still would n 't work !
the battery life is ok , but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on
the setup software did everything
when you dial a number , you 'll need to check the screen to see that the number entered is correct
i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far
navigation could be better , but there is n 't really anything the zen xtra can 't do once you 've gotten comfortable with it
when i turned the phone on , the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is
to eliminate any smells we simple stuck a stick up room deodorizer inside the lid
there were many times when i clicked the automatic shutter and nothing happens
very good balance in the hands and lighter than most 3 1 4 hp models
2 ) the remote works , but then it does not work , and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong
this is my fourth linksys product and , aside from the rough start , i 'm very satisfied with this router
in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class
because steve jobs is a twisted individual and he made sure that he ruined this device by giving it an unrepeatable 18 month battery
one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia , so standard headphones will not work
i tried to call norton , and the only numbers they list on their sites are either for non tech customer service ( tried this one and hung up after 75 minute of muzak ) or they have a 30 tech support number
solid , high quality construction
the dvd player does not work properly
the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options
the hitachi has plenty of power , runs smooth , and cuts effortlessly through maple ( with freud bits ! )
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times
the great and versatile ipod
the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution
it 's a very intuitive program
the phone is very light weight
it is a bit difficult to get the unit open ( the advice to take it slowly is sound ) , but now that our son is walking and exploring , i consider this a positive attribute !
it 's very quiet for a universal motor driven tool , and the height adjustment stick and variable speed control are great
why bother when it works perfectly with media player 10 ?
this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it
im at full capacity ! ! ! ! i called syman tic and they said they don 't know why but i should get tech 's support at 35 hr to help ! ! i did call them and was on hold for 55 minutes until i hung up !
the prints are beautiful !
i was up all night trying to make the stupid thing work , to no avail
sound quality the ipod 's sound quality is pretty good
i had never liked the idea of the diaper genie because of the refills
the 6600 was the best phone i could find with these options that i could get with t mobile
in fact , it caused my system to hang more times than not , so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource 100
the sound quality is very good
as i said , i don 't regret the purchase at all
i haven 't seen any problems yet , but if you don 't like to tinker a bit , this player can be a little challenging to set up
the ipod is a very nice product , which given reasonable care , should give a lot of service
it took me three days , to the tune of neil young 's song piece of cr ! , to get this to work with the satellite hookup i was hired to connect this wireless network up to
the front cover ( which you remove to take out the battery ) feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid
the screen may be a little smaller , but it is very readable and does n 't come in the overused blue
bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense filters choices
i was looking for a phone which synced with mac osx using bluetooth , had decent battery life , could check email , had good reception , nice screen size and was durable ( i break often break small gadgets )
transferring files couldn 't be easier thanks to the included software bundle
first , the sound quality is okay , but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the eax can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes
it is the 'first generation ' of the player , and while i still agree that it is a great alternative to the ipod , i think there are many others that would be a much better value for your buck
it plays alternate video formats ( cads , svcds , cods ) very well
however , i suspect that many people are having a bad experience do not purchase this product
this one is particularly bothersome allegedly one can use the zen micro as a portable drive to store and transport data from one computer to another
the startup time , quality of pictures and videos is outstanding
if you use linux and want gr ps and or want to use a handsfree bluetooth device , and want a decent camera this is the phone for you
overall build quality , good macros results , impressive video quality , good pictures with flash ( good colours , sharp results ) , excellent auto white balance
i tried to play the song three times , with no success
i purchased this camera before it went on sale , and while i wouldn 't have minded keeping the extra , it was definitely worth it
the earbuds that come with it are n 't that bad
2 ) the body construction buttons , casing , etc , are too plastic
getting files onto it is quick and painless
wow was that disappointing and we didn 't even have it 6 months before it broke
it 's a great looking , easy to use device but it 's the sound quality which is truly amazing far better than my sony mini disc player
20 gb or 40 gb ? the pros of the 40 gb comes with a dock station and double storage space ( 10 , 000 songs )
have had the nokia 6600 for a year now and am generally very happy with it and with t mobile
now this router is not the cheapest on the market
the dynamic playlists ( now playing , i be live creative calls it ) feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate
i replaced it with a router raiser and it works much better
the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n 't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk
your choice of ten colors in a beatiful package
the zen offered a great alternative
norton online support does not even acknowledge this problem nor does the computer company that preloaded it on our new computer
i try navigating to a chapter past 34 via the menu and it would n 't do it !
the lcd screen is too small since there are so many cameras that have larger ones
the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation a slightly audible click if i am not listening for the progress from one track to the next i do n 't even notice the click
however , the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality
thank you apple ! you make fabulous products
their products have been great and have saved my bacon on numerous occasions
we just buy the smaller bags that come like 250 to a roll and are scented and they are like 6 00 and they work great
no in box accessories an arm strap , belt strap , case , or anything would be nice , but nope moveable parts this makes me almost want to keep my 3rd gen over a 4th with moveable parts , its easy to damage an ipod at a gym , so this is for more casual listeners note the ipod mini doesn 't have moveable parts and is made of titanium
even when i set it to low , it 's still very hard for me to adjust the player to where and what i want it to do
pi ii 1ghz 512mb rd ram windows xp pro 80gb hd i was able to uninstall nis 2003 and install nis 2004 with no trouble
works great ! ! ! !
after telling the rep and his tech supervisor the problem the only answer was to uninstall the program ( which i had already done )
purchased this router a few months back , no problems whatsoever
although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon
the nomad is not ugly , it is not that big , it comfortably fits in my pocket , or heavy , and the controls are not hard to get used to
3 play java games on it
i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes no crashes or problems
it 's easy enough to pop it open to see what song you 're listening to
the phone does not have an mp3 player , fm radio , 200k color screen , megapixel camera , quad band , pda , photo editor
i particularly like the txt file which records all the control information for all the pictures you take
creative has been making computer sound equipment for decades and with the zen micro it finally has something with enough quality and , yes , charm to win a nice size of the digital player pie
the vibration is not top
after less than 24 hours it turned out to be a huge disappointment , for myself and for my parents , for whom it was a gift
the manual mode is feature rich and i can 't wait to get the hang of it
the menus are easy to scroll through they are laid out naturally , and make sense
secondly , all info can be sent to a computer and w o the hassle of usb wires
the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select , you have to push straight in or it sticks
the package also comes with a usb cable , an ac adapter , a pair of headphones ( they 're okay until you get a better pair ) , a stand , and a microfiber pouch to carry your zen touch in
the songs recorded with fm are as good as the original signal
( on here of course ) also , a couple dvd 's would n 't play and they were new ones !
the touch buttons are textured so that your finger sdon 't slip which was very thoughtful
it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation
3 months of use and it no longer recognizes anything
also love waking up to music with attached speakers
i built my own router table with a tilt up top made a hand crank to replace the height adjustment knob these two things make it easy to change out raise or lower the bits
the sound quality is also nice after i hooked up my sony headphones instead of those factory earbuds it comes with
what impressed me most was the sound
the fit and finish of the product is first rate
the only con i can think of is the lack of a mega pixel camera
i 'm not one who uses web browsing , so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs
this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made
the edge guide is top quality , easy to install and accurate
seems to read most dvds fine , and reads quietly ( i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise )
finally , i reiterate my thumbs down rating for t mobile as a carrier
nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games , graphics and ringtones from www crazy cellphone com
the cover that came with it did n 't fit very well
both of them keep disconnecting on me and interruptions are 3 or 4 times per day at best
overall this is a slightly better than average phone
my file log was not responding and the program was not blocking any cookies or unauthorized sites
same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex nothing
both the antivirus and firewall are integrated into one piece of software and they update together
the size of the camera is perfect
i was using the cheaper pail and it worked ok until the opening device fell apart
i got a 1gb mmc upgrade for this phone and now i can
5 ) the cheap , user replaceable battery ( 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs 100 to replace
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them
my only significant complaint is sound quality
for the most part this is a good dvd player
takes excellent photos
the sliding latch is does not stay in place
the controls on the player are very simple , no need for a manual
it 's good
7 picture quality is excellent
also , diapers and wipes get stuck in the grove below the piston
t simply the best player on the market for a really low price , so why look anywhere else ?
i absolutely love it
i took it to my father 's house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him
the next problem was that it didn 't recognize all the installed components , so it would not update them , most notably and importantly , virus definitions
the 6600 has more amenities than most world phone , camera ( vga zoom night mode timer ) , video ( w audio zoom ) , speaker ( good sound ) , bluetooth , infrared , modem for computers , electronic wallet , internet access , calendar , calculator , converter and more
i don 't know , maybe i got a defective one but first , the player would not shut off , next , the player would not come on i had to send it away to get repaired
it 's kinda heavy , kinda like having a walkman
the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there
i bought this camera two days ago , and i 'm very pleased to say that it has been worth the money
i did have to cut off the ears that hold the template guide in place so i could get those big panel raising bits in it
in a week of use i 've never had to reboot the router
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature loaded , high performance , travel size camera , i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality 4 mega pixel
well , this apex dvd player turned out great !
i left the camera in my car in maine ( not a very hot place ) and the lcd screen cracked !
sound quality is great , fm tuner is fine , as is the recorder
have tried to contact apex via e mail ( customerservice apexdigital com ) , but the e mail address is not valid
nice little phone light compact
this is my first digital camera and i could n 't be happier
the best thing to do with this version , is to leave it on the store shelf it doesn 't work , and will cost you an enormous amount of your time , not to mention your hard earned dollars
the device looks very cool , i think ( exactly as the photos promise ) , it 's comfortable and lightweight in my jacket pocket , and the interface and controls are easy enough to navigate after a bit of practice
and also , since it is teri band and since it uses sim card , you can just use it in europe and many other parts of the world , wherever gsm exists
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this
i did not have any of the installation problems that people highlighted here
all in all though i 'm very happy with my new mp3 player
all in all i am pleased with the router
there is no photo viewing option , however , there is a 20 gb photo ipod , but it costs 20 more
nokia and t mobile really teamed up well on this baby
with eax on , you can modify your sound , with 4 different presets , which is pretty good , you can get different variations with it
works great , no odor , and uses regular bags
it 's fast , feels great in your hand and looks great too
for the money apex machines have good features
2 ) music organization is based on id3 ( by genre , artist , album , etc ) and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id3 information
i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer
third , the poor design continues with the case
8 battery life is excellent
this is overall the best point and shoot camera i 've used
pros large hard drive for the 20gb and 40gb are both affordable
the software comes with plenty of defaults genres
the range is terrific , i am using this for my home and i was transferring at 50 mbs from my backyard
the setup and transfer process was cake for me
this is a wonderful camera
i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had
however after playing with it for three weeks now , i 'm convinced , the zen micro is superior
the canon computer software used to download , sort , upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use
proven canon built quality and lens
the speed is the same as dali up , where i live we do not have wifi everywhere so this is my version of it until we catch up
all in all , not very good
i do not need to repeat what 's great about this phone
upside this one , like most nokias , receives a consistently strong signal ( i 've tried some samsung and sony ericsson models which were very weak on the reception front )
the in program id3 tag editing is a strong point , as well
this is really a nice diaper pail
just easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter id tags and sort your music according to your liking , by artist , song title , genre , etc
and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play
it 's overkill for simple snapshots , unless you 've got way too much money to blow
radio quality weak reception
6 play game boy color games on it with go boy
i say adequate because it was enough to get wireless working , but nowhere near enough instruction to do the proper configuration job that i could have done if so !
my first router is a safety hazard if you do not pay attention and are not very careful
it feels like i 'm back to the days of 56k dial up internet service , even though i 'm running a dell 2ghz pentium 4 with 256mb memory and have had excellent broadband service for the past year
the menu pops up after 3 seconds the picture takes a while to load from its slow card memory
while i like the performance of the phone in every regard , i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it
i have about 6 gb used on my ipod so far ( well over 1000 songs ) , and as far as i can tell , all of them play at near cd quality
it was also the most appealing
with the plunge lift all my bit changing has been done above the table , although i still have to reach below the table to operate the spindle lock ( and , of course , the speed and on off controls )
what a junk
the file ripping transfering software that comes with the player is easy to use
the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen
i don 't know why cnet says there is a problem with focus , i have all my pictures sharp and high quality
we resorted to using small plastic bags to store the dirty diapers and dumping them in a trash can and using the diaper champ for wet diapers only
the diaper champ is the best we found !
it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want
this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands
the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well re cored mp3s
and the body construction in general has quite a bit of plastic , a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330
as of october , 2004 , these products are not working and i 'm ready to demand a refund from symantec
but overall this is a good camera with a ' really good ' picture clarity an exceptional close up shooting capability
the karma is only 5 more , it 's small , had a 20 gig drive and supports more formats including gog
i am a big fan of itunes , simply because it is terribly fast and convenient if you are buying the songs from the itunes site
take quick pictures with excelent resolution
even the shorter battery life , though , has not impaired my positive experience with the zen micro in any way
i have owned some kind of creative audio product since 1993 and have never had to call tech support
the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to
diaper champ is by far the best diaper pail !
this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well
pick your favorite color and buy it
2 ) nice features , like web browser , camera , video recorder , speaker phone ( very usefully ) , clear voice reception
actually , the creative zen micro solves all that
the ones i 've kept ( porter cables , dew alts , bosch , and this hitachi ) have proven their worth over the years , however , when i need a real workhorse , i grab this router
well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise
all in all it hasn 't been a bad product
it uses the extend able mmc memory , it is perfect for storing videos , pictures and mp3s
the only thing i don 't like is the small size ( 8 meg ) memory card that comes with it
great camera , great investment !
i have a couple hundred contacts and the menu loads within a few seconds , no big deal
( it had locked up multiple times previously , but always managed to work after wards ) this time , the touch screen wouldn 't respond to me and none of the buttons worked
it 's low profile , space saving design looks nice
both are very easy to learn use , and intuitive enough for even a novice
i use it for ripping cds , which it does a pretty good job of
my op ion is concentrate on what you need now , this product has excellent range , holds a teddy connection , ha sent even drooped one and i have it for more than a month now
6 ) excellent battery life 14 hours beats ipod 's
i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song playlist etc fast enough
still , at least from my perspective , a great camera for the money , and i 'm a happy camper !
i have found too many bugs in norton internet security professional to recommend it to any one without extreme patience and experience
i have stored around 60 cd 's ( at 160kbps ) on this and have barely touched the available memory
there 's even an equalizer ( under settings ) that allows you to adjust the sound for acoustic , bass booster , bass reducer , classical , dance , deep , and electronic
it holds quite a few diapers , and pops them in quickly and easily
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because , as other reviewers have pointed out , the construction is pretty flimsy
2 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations
price !
as for itunes , i don 't find it to be as good as the windows media player as a computer mp3 player , but it is good enough
exposure compensation in 1 3 stop increments ( i leave it set on 1 3 stop to brighten up the default exposure , which goes a bit dark for my taste )
navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch
it works well with my vip adapter , which is also a linksys
the battery power discharges rapidly especially on using the web browser
autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all
the use of 65536 ( 16bit ) colors ensures you get your share of animations and icons on your phone
we were able to obtain a norton corporate edition of antivirus only ( no firewall or utilities ) and so far it 's great
after scouring the various boards i find this is an arbitrary and pervasive problem
i could make phone calls from locations i previously could not ( like my apartment )
because the engineers at creative screwed up the design of the headphone jack
you can turn this phone into a gaming machine , a camcorder or a digital camera , an mp3 player , a movie viewer , a voice recorder , a personal secretary , a gaps map browser , a book , a multifunction remote controller , practically everything that you can do with the computer , plus it is a phone ( ! ! ) and also you can carry it in your pocket )
headphones suck , i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature
the battery is replaceable ( a real plus ) and there is a leather case ( another real plus )
norton pops up a window about the intrusions and gives me as much detail as possible about where the intrusion is coming from
the latter will provide better coverage in more remote areas of the states but still operates in many countries , excluding new zealand and australia
nothing spectacular is done by internet security or by antivirus software
i got it working fast enough
the screen is bright , easy to see in the daylight , with nice colors
the camera is very easy to use , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group
over all a fantastic very compact camera , which made us experience photography on a totally new level !
at works as well as can be expected for products in this space and the company backs it up with good support
the interface has a sassier flair and the blue lit trimming is an added bonus
i can keep one hand on my baby and dump the diaper at the same time , it is that simple
i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks , and the ease of use is wonderful
what an upgrade ! ! !
the good news is that the creative support is very responsive and after some emails and postal exchanges , i had a new zen
most of the other players i checked dont have user serviceable battery
the blue backlit lcd looks really neat and is easy to read
sound excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice ( check cons ) it also doubles as a radio , which is a nice feature when you are bored
the camera is as easy to use as a point and shoot , and with instant review on the lcd screen , you can retake any flubbed shots on the spot
also , i can 't understand why the software does not ignore the when it lists the cds in alphabetical order
with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority ( for high speed subjects ) , aperture priority ( for focal length ) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality
i recently bought the linksys wrt54g router and have been very happy with the router itself
reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive
it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot
still , that 's enough time that i 'm still satisfied , if a bit grouchy with creative 's over hyped promises
size extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you
i purchased this phone for just 50 and there is no end to what i can do with it
after some research on the net , i discovered that there is indeed a flaw with the current wrt54g design ( wrt54g , version 3 , which amazon currently sells )
it is quiet and has plenty of power
all in all , this is another excellent creative product
travel with it without knowing you have it in your pocket
flawless
we found that when you put a dirty diaper into the top loader , there was a tendency to get streaks which would then get on the plunger which would then have to get cleaned each time it was used
this fixes some glitches such as the player freezing
the auto color balance is often fooled by dense clouds
the player is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium
after about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd 's are dirty
their customer service agents are always prompt and polite and my service is terrific
there is also a small covering for the lens , so you need not worry that the lens will get scratched
after considering my needs further and researching the marketplace , i decided on the s100
it has plenty of power
yeah this program protects your computer all right by locking you off the internet
i just upgraded to the linksys wrt54g wireless g router last month and i am very happy with the quality of the product
apple has definately fulfilled its reputation in making quality equipment , and surprisingly wasn 't as expensive as its reputation normally holds
while it didn 't have all the features i would have liked , it was better than anything else i could find at the time
2 ) no games it has a cool screen why not use it
it 's a highly rated , kick ass firewall program that 's bundled with the venerable norton antivirus , plus extras ( like norton antispam norton parental control ) that make this security suite a must have for people who have broadband internet access
in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click , the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results
this isn 't the most rugged phone ever but then your not gonna play airplane with this , are you
cons difficult to open to change bag twice my bags caught on a sharp edge inside and snagged as i was pulling out leaving dirty diapers all over the floor
the software , mediasource , can not work on my pc ( laptop , intel p4 2 0 , xp os )
the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra 30 gb is the software
if you 've been listening to cd 's in your car for awhile , dealing with the drop off in sound quality may take some getting used to
fm transmitter ( belkin has a good one ) to use zen with your car stereo fm tuner latest find connected this baby to my 3800 audiophile audio system and it produced clean sound compared to ipod
get it , it 's woth every penny ! !
great sound good interface replaceable , powerful battery good software wake up , sleep timers multiple play modes
4 my idea was that it was an all in one , and that theory once again proves wrong , this phone ex cells at nothing , less than average in everything , if you seriously need any of the other than phone functionalists , you 'll be disappointed if you have lots of money and bought it for the love of gadgets then fine but don 't expect to get much done
the stand that comes with it is very useful to prop it up on the desk
seems it is always difficult to press to make a selection
it 's easy
the macro mode is exceptional , the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject
linksys is more costlier than others and is a home consumer division of disco
the only disappointment so far has been battery life
2 ) having unfilled id3 tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called unknown
i 'm going to try to get a refund but considering all the hoops i jumped through ( emails , downloads , reboots , a purge and another download , plus reading through the help menu ) a refund should be twice as frustrating
finding all the albums , songs etc is much easier than you would think it would be even if you have 20 gig ( well 18 gig ) worth of music
features click wheel to navigate ability to work with windows or mac optional back lighting ( you can have it on all the time , or have it shut off to save battery power after 5 , 10 , or 20 seconds ) ability to download pda info automatic or manual download from itunes when ipod is plugged into your computer
sound i 'm no audiophile but i was amazed by the clarity the player had , it was much better than the sound card on my computer and louder too
i had a question about the pros and cons of turning off the norton firewall vs the windows firewall , and waited 45 minutes to speak with a tech support representative because i did not have a customer priority id number
the rate plans are also very good , at least for me
this way i never have to be ripped off by the carrier for stupid ringtones , i can get whatever i want
not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days , it just would not recognize anything i pop in it
plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad
i just got an older 866 mhz system with 512 pc 133 ram and it also runs fine on that
for the zen creative focused on packaging which looked well thought out , well presented and easy to open and put back together
the creative mediasource software that comes with the zen micro is cluttered , and excludes my favorite feature in itunes , the ability to automatically copy everything you import into a certain folder
you can use the ob ex file transfer service with bluetooth from linux ( kde bluetooth provides a nice integration into conqueror for this ) for sending files to the phone
it is not reliable
the speakerphone , the radio , all features work perfectly
all in all , this product is definitely one i would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price
after some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative , and i have not been disappointed
the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warranty period is to expire
the pictures are tack sharp , colors are vivid , and at 7 mega pixels the quality is plenty high to manipulate and crop images to your hearts desire
when i hooked it up it only produced sound a cd played fine , but with a dvd i only got the audio no picture !
so for the money it costs for one of those top of the line models i 've got a good router a nice table to put it in i like that
fm receiver it has none
fits comfortably in my inside jacket pocket or in my pants pocket
with the right firmware , drag and drop to and from the player like any other jump drive
it works better and has more useful features than nis 2003
audio is mono and fairly acceptable , quiet also with little distortions
the scene mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a regular setting
3 it is very compact but the controls are so well designed that they 're still easy to use
nothing has broken on it , and it plays all the dvds i have
i have especially enjoyed the 640x480 mode , while not a replacement for a dedicated video camera , its quality easily surpasses that of my old hi 8 camera and is perfect for quick clips of things that still images just dont describe ( max 8 mins at 640 30fps on a one gig card )
the interface took a little getting used to
i like it 's shape and it 's keypad and joystick
it 's not the heaviest around ( i think porter cable has that distinction ) , but i found its combination of weight and power really too much to allow precise handheld operation
battery life is very good , i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so
the camera is solid , performs well , takes good pictures , and the battery lasts pretty long if you disable the lcd viewfinder
tech support from apex is literally nonexistent
this camera also has a great feel and weight to it
the dvd player just would 't recognize them
overall i 'm incredibly impressed with my new zen touch
recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available
so , i was one who was ready to give it 5 stars with no complaints at all
it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen , and if the button did n 't cover up the ac jack
after consulting with creative 's customer support , they determined that the hard drive was broken and the only recourse was to send it in for repair , which would cost me 40 , since it 's past the 90 day warranty ( pretty short warranty )
this is a fantastic tool to use
the battery recharges raul fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice
try before you buy if at all possible although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod , the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface
this phone is highly recommended otherwise
they claim to respond in a 24 hour period yet it 's been 2 weeks without a reply
the touch sarene navigation will take a little getting used to , but once you do , and while the zen is still alive , it 's a great alternative to the marching in lock step with the click wheel commies
after we discovered the problems , we tried to contact apex ( flor 3 months ) , but we never got in touch with them the customer support telephone number is always busy , and they do not answer their web customer support
do not buy any home version of norton anything
the fact that you can assign ringtones to people and or groups is really cool
am so glad i bought this camera
however , it needs to be quite quiet for it to work at all dosn 't work at all in the car , for example
holds the odor in nicely !
this is due to the unusually slow autofocus system
by focusing exclusively on quality rather than excessive marketing , they have introduced a player that can look the ipod straight in the eye and not flinch
the power is incredible , it cut through md and plywood like butter
this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in
i 'd give it 5 stars if the automatic modes were better and if there were true manual focus and exposure modes
granted , i have only used this dvd player for about 2 hours setting it up for my mom for christmas , but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player
there are lots of interesting features included such as eax , and customization
don 't worry this player rocks
the sound is not loud enough when i play back the video clips on the camera
the reception and sound quality are top notch
to set up the box , wap , and ether nest bridge , with the encryption on was less then 30 mins
there are instructions to encrypt your personal wireless network so no one else can end up hogging stealing your bandwidth
the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out ( as all lithium batteries do ) , you will be able to buy another easily
the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products , which is very dumb
i 've sent 10 e mails to their customer service department requesting an ra with no response
one of the dvd 's i received as a christmas present kept freezing
it looks great and is loaded with features
there is no odor and it is very easy to use
pertaining to the speed issue i got 54mps while i was in the same room
on occasion i 'm not able to connect to the phone with isync via bluetooth but i found that rebooting the phone seems to solve this problem
i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again
they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same sounding name ( and they are long )
i especially like the more commonly used buttons , such as play , pause , and stop , to be larger and conveniently placed
i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time
very cool features great camera with zoom cool quality pictures great ringtones bluetooth feature is great
the volume range is great , so you can blast it if you want
i downloaded this set from norton , and within minutes my internet connection failed and my pc was almost dead due to registry problems from the download
tough as nails
i got this phone yesterday and didn 't find any problems with it yet
the headphones are not very comfortable , but most people have a certain style they like so just go buy new ones or keep the ones you have
the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot
i forgot , the case does n 't fit
for the price it is a well spent investment !
the m12v has been great
feature for feature , i find it a very sweet little player equipped with a higher end headphone system , between this and th larger zen hardly use my home stereo system anymore
the zen lives up to the audio quality i love and expect
1 ) price gb of storage
if you 're looking for a 3hp plunge router , the hitachi m12v is your best bet to stretch your equipment budget
i took it out one day and the lcd was not working
norton 's memory usage on systems with 512 mb is very low
simply , the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point
creating and modifying playlists is easy and clean
this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues
i compared this to a lot of other cameras , believe me , it 's value for money
despite this minor disappointment , i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography
it will not replace your high end 35mm slr but it 's a great toy to keep near you at all times for snapshots
i like some local stations , stern , and npr , and so the radio seemed like a great option
start up is so quick
but the major problem i had was with the software
the menu options appear one at a time , taking up the whole screen , and one has to scroll down one by one , or have memorized where they are in the menu order , to select them by using the number keypad
this was possible due to the variable speed settings for any sized bit
battery life is not long enough if and only if you take a lot of video clips and play it back on the camera a lot of times the camera battery gets a little bit warm too when you use it for a long time but it 's normal
and the video quality is amazing
great phone , i 'd buy another
it wo n 't play 80 of my movies , which are all store bough ten
but , dollar for dollar , this dvd player is probably the best out there
i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it
remember , this phone uses an operating system symbian and it 's feature rich w 65k colors
my friend has an ipod , and although the sound quality probably won 't meet most audiophile standards , the product itself is better than anything creative has made
before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp3 players but finally decided on this one , and now that i have it i could n 't be happier and i 'm convinced it 's the best one out there
unfortunately it can 't play all of the dvd
you can see the lens barrel in the view finder
it is currently permanently mounted ( 3 years now ) in my router table and will most likely stay there until its shot
no smell , easy to use with one hand free , and best of all it uses regular tall kitchen garbage bags so you don 't get suckered in to using only the bags made for the pail that are impossible to find !
maybe this new design is more durable than the last , but i kind of doubt it
it 's being used daily and i have had none of the problems reported by other reviewers ( headphone jack , player locking up , etc )
range of functions as indicated above it has something for everyone point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography
you do not have to waste money or time trying to purchase special bags for the champ
i did see the review here and other places about a cracked lcd screen
symantec should give us all a refund and apology !
( i never know when the champ is full as there is no way too tell even though not particularly aesthetic , how about making the champ clear and see through ? ) so , i lift the lid and find a wad of diaper , which i must remove , usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full
this is an excellent router for the money
there isn 't much features on the ipod at all , except games
for a specific location , i still think its a great phone
finding a particular song ( s ) or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy
it gives you the most bang for your buck , period
it is mindless to operate
the biggest problem is the installation
amazon is awesome !
all in all this is a 5 star piece of equipment
it seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that 's inserted maybe 10 seconds of wait
the environmental audio , however , is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it ( i encode my songs at 192 256 kbps without variable bit rates )
feels solid in hand
the player looks great , feels great , and sounds great
this camera is closest to perfect than any other diagram that is 4 5 megapixel
i 'm giving it 4 stars because the setup process was so miserable
to address two previous somewhat negative reviews ( 1 ) yes , the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder however , the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder
just too numerous to list fm radio , which has weak reception , but at least it there , and a microphone , to name just two
playlists can be made on the fly , without aid of a computer , and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your ' now playing ' selections or playlists
the only main drawback is the fact that the voice dialing system is kinda picky
also much less stinky
another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world
but since it 's so small , it isn 't a big deal to bring it with me
while i am not happy that a solid state device died after such a short period of time , my quick review of this product space did not yield any other brands that seem much better than linksys
unlike my 3 other mp3 players , this thing will only work properly if you have id3 tags on all of your tracks
all in all , creative has definitely come up with a winner in terms of product design and features , and i look forward to the nomad zen line of products seizing more market share as people begin to realize that quality is a better determinant of experience than quantity and hype
i can 't write enough positive things about this great little camera !
buttons size is ok for me , my wife , but not my granny
basic usage is easy , but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have n 't used
all in all , i believe this is arguably the best non slr digital camera on the market
i like the size and shape
while the software may not be as easy as i tunes , it is not difficult to use by any stretch
i am getting better speeds on all my web programs
i 've taken about hundred shot with the canon , in varying lighting situations , all in auto mode , and not one blurry picture ! ! !
sound this is where i love zen the most
the volume level of the phone is not all that good
3 ) the joystick design they are using on the new nokias gives you a great degree of control
this camera is truely superb
7 ) some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch
i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player
the depth adjustment was sloppy
mine is as easy to use as the mini without any firmware download
2 ) not very ergonomically you 'll find even for a point and shoot lens )
has a great helpline
all in all , its good enough for its price as long as it doesnt break again due to normal use
) can 't be left in the car it immediately shuts down with an overheating error if left in a hot car for too long
on the up side , the phone has amazing battery life
another thing i like about this camera is the way that you can swap colors around and the impressive video quality i would advise any person in the market for a camera to pay the little extra on the hefty 500 price tag and get a quality camera
this one is really great
it is small enough to fit easily in a coat pocket or purse
when i played back a symphony orchestra you would swear that you were seated dead center in front of the orchestra it 's that good !
6 ) the case occludes the display screen when it is closed
small size
despite a critical start , this phone deserves four stars because it accomplishes what it sets out to do ( which is pretty lofty ) does more than most does it well is dependable
3 ) the champ is odor free for at least 15 months
unless you have an enormous music audio book library , the 20 gb model should have more than adequate storage capacity , with a stated ability to hold 5000 songs
best camera ever from the image quality , color , function , i can say almost everything
let the champ win you over !
4 ) the viewfinder is bordered lcd skying
stay away from this junk
the digital zoom is crap
my sd500 focuses flawlessly , does not whine during video , and my pictures are razor sharp
the product i rate five stars ,
i still give the ipod five stars , though , as it could have been something i did incorrectly during the install ( though i did follow the onscreen prompts ) so i 'll give apple the benefit of the doubt
i 've read about the issues with the scroll bar , but they must have taken care of that now
the panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said
unfortunately , the player would not read any of my region one dvds even though they were not damaged in any way
also , the wma compression format is superior to mp3 , especially at lower bit rates , so i needed a player that could handle wma and integrate well with my windows xp computers
it has raised the bar owing to number of features it offers and the absolute ease of use delight
i 'm currently using a sony vaio s 150 ( which i bought at the end of this past august ) , and it takes about five minutes just to boot the system in fact , i 've taken to just hibernating , rather than shutting down completely
it holds almost a week 's worth of diapers , and you don 't need expensive refills any kitchen bags work
no need to pay for the special refills that the other brands require !
1 ) the champ is easy to use
about the only legitimate criticism from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder
i am happy with the fact that i can use any bag in there and dont ' have to pay out the nose for replacements
the nikon coolpix 4300 is wonderful easy to use , high quality , and compact in size
colors 10 variety of hot colors made it difficult to choose from
the creative zen micro is a zen micro killer , not an ipod killer
9 3x built in optical zoom is a lot for this price range
to keep it short , this is cheaper , and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod
luckily the soft start helped before it took the wood and tossed it or worse case , a finger
i just wished that it didn 't fill up so fast !
do not buy this product
the adjustment knob seemed ok , but when lowering the router , i have to practically pull it down while turning the knob
i wo n 't go into the details here , as the online sites ( steve 's digicams , previews ) go into great depth in their reviews , but i am very pleased with the features , the speed , the picture quality , the flexibility , the automation , and the functional conveniences this camera offers
not only is it inconvenient , but also the battery life span is short
absolutely no problems with this router
the linksys technical support site has nothing about configuring the router for use with a mac
i am annoyed that the player 's not automatically recognized as a hard drive
also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player
when the player was working it was great , but
it works easily with one hand , which is important
3 ) the nomad explorer ( winxp style interface ) works well to transfer files back and forth to use the nomad as an external although the tech support web site states that the primary intended purpose of the player is as a player
especially for the price amazon gives it at ( i was unable to get mine through amazon due to some credit complications )
it works well enough ( so far ) for me to be satisfied with it , and it 's possible that i 'm missing something
audio formats supports both mp3 , wma and yeah , wav too
i did it and it was worse the second time around unbelievable
reliability build i dropped the player once from about 4 ft , and it fell hard , but kept on playing
the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out
pc software that comes with the player is not as simple as i tunes but its not bad at all
you can manage your profile , change the contrast of backlight , make different type of display , either list or tabbed
the height adjustment knob is a bit flimsy , but it works well and provides good accuracy
relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots
creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality , poor product support , difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack
the computer interface is 90 good , only losing points due to the fact that creative branding is all over the place within it
yes , the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range
it also works just fine for international calls
and it 's the largest diaper pail i 've seen without taking up more floor space
after installation , which was very simple i downloaded any updated software from the creative website , before i downloaded any music
it 's the same body as the popular elp2 aps camera ( take a look at a standard credit card from your wallet and you 'll have an idea of the front profile ! )
ripping the songs , even with my 1 1 usb connection is still very quick , and the quality is very good
i use the regular kitchen trash bags and it is so easy to empty
the plunge lock and power switch are very easily accessible which is a must when doing free hand routing
before you run out and buy an ipod , understand something there are reasons the zen is worth encountering this kind of hassle , principally excellent ( for mp3 ) sound quality
we tried it out christmas night and it worked great
the auto focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes they are dummy proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera
the setup process for the nomad is infuriating , and the interface with the player is sub par
this product is amazing and better than the ipod you can get at the same price
also , some other mp3 players such as the nitrus allow you to play wma ( windows media audio ) files , whereas the ipod does not
equipment included is average , but that is n 't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for
the power , low noise operation , and speed control makes up for the problems i have experienced
all in all , the diaper champ serves its purpose , but it does not live up to its good reviews
i tried to use the fm radio option , but it doesn 't seem to really pick up the stations i listen , however i am going to try it in a different location , it may have just been my residential location
3 ) 4x zoom is nice
i upgraded both my card and router and really had no problems with installation on my sony vaio laptop ( xp operating system )
i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver
the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd )
it really is a great buy if you are loo kin at having just one modem but many computers around the house
i love the rounded edges now , fits so much better in a pocket , jeans or suit
too bad the product is cumbersome and intertwined trying to do so much at one time
it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing !
the 6610 excels as a cell phone , thank god
handsfree future is good , but not too exciting
i think it 's great
also , it takes any kitchen sized trash bag , so there is no special bag to stock
) no locked in proprietary business like apple this baby plays wmas too
i know the saying is you get what you pay for but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this there is no excuse
6 the nikon coolpix line is a well established line so you know support and parts are going to be available even when nikon releases a newer model
even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image
its also smaller , and gets more looks
for the price and features it is really good
it is an extremely cool cozmo
the software is very easy to use , and within 30 minutes of opening my box , i was out and about listening to any one of my 80 cds
i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer
this camera is ideal for people who want more power , but do n 't want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera
frankly , i think this is one of the niftiest pieces of hardware i 've ever used
it would either not play the song at all , or skip wildly , no matter that the unit was resting on my desk
moreover , apart from the plastic cable cover , the camera has a nice , solid feel about it , and it 's so tiny , i take it with me wherever i go
the software that comes with the digital elph is very nice and intuitive
2 it is easy enough for my grandmother to use
the locations of various buttons on one side or the other is somewhat illogical
first , let me say that i got the 20gb ipod for christmas , and i most likely would not have spent the 300 myself
its the easiest thing to setup i thought , and i am only 16 so with all that said , buy the router ! ! ! !
b ) the screen is hard to read the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display
they are a royal pain to install , and don 't function properly once finally installed if you can install them at all
however , if there was one thing i liked about the creative , it would be the car adapter
i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd 's transferred
the program is fully featured , with much of what you 'd want from a security program
overall it is a great unit hopefully creative labs or some other vendor will soon come out with some accessories for it
sending the unit to the company of purchase which costs about 90 ) , the ability to record with a built in microphone ( great for recording reminders and meetings ) , very sturdy construction , and not to mention the sound quality is excellent !
and really this is the best phone one could have
this was an awesome player , before the video output no longer worked ( after about 3 weeks )
what disappoints me the most that a software like that is not cheap gets zero support form symantec , if you want support , they 'll charge you a fee !
there are number of downloads needed available for this phone they will be text ed to you at no cost
we just use the glad tall kitchen trash can bags with odor shield from target and they work wonderfully
placement of the buttons and software user interface is near perfect
i have overall been disappointed with nokia in the past , finding that samsung and motorola tended to have better quality phones
so much safer than the others that require a two handed operation !
i 've owned many norton products in my time , and for the most part , i 've been pleased with their performance
i decided to save the and opted for the zen xtra and i was not disappointed
but for now it appears that this player does n 't play well with itunes
so so 1 customer service 6 calls half were efficient other half were equally incompetent
there are 3 computers in my house all getting wireless connection from this router , and everybody is happy with it
yes , there is a belt clip , but that doesn 't hold the extra battery and usb cable
i gave it only 3 stars due to the fact that the 1st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance ( less than 2 ft )
when we tried to hook up the first one , it was broken the motor would not eject discs or close the door
looks sleek , compact , has a radio
e ) the case is too small it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage
i am very pleased with it so far
the setup was very easy
i think this is it 's biggest flaw
the system is terrific in size and design , imo looking better than the ipods
awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package
what the hell is wrong with this thing
after hooking the thing up , i found that it would only played less than 50 of the dvds i put in it
this is a great camera for you !
the design of the col lets is excellent and far exceeds any of the craft man ( toy junk ) routers i have previously purchased
the one i purchased for a friend as a gift will not read any dvd disc
perfect size ! beats the competition by leaps and bounds
the greatest thing about the software ( in my humble ) is that it reads your cd info
i 've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow , car , boat and wind
many have complained about the software included but in my opinion it 's easy to use and effective
the ss body is wonderful , feels high quality
i have a modern pc with lots of speed and memory , but this firewall just brought it to a halt
this is only a problem at night , during the day the screen is very easy to see
i highly recommend this phone
i 've owned this router for over 8 years and am somewhat satisfied with it
decent battery on the average size , but the 40gb comes with a dock
it was so easy my toddler would dispose of her on diapers
5 stars all the way !
i find it a bit difficult to manage the very tiny buttons and impossible to read the icons without my reading glasses on
so reliability is the winner here for the ipod
the phone must be shut down taken apart to change the memory card and turning the phone back on takes a little while
overall i 'm happy with my toy
sure , it 's a little bigger than the ipod , but not by much
for the price i think this is a remarkably fun mp3 player
then my dvds would stop playing in the middle , or not even be read at all
all i have to say is that the pics i get with my sd500 are both rich and color and high in detail , the user interface is awesome , the battery charger is tiny and super light and sd cards are relatively cheap and getting cheaper all the time
the sound quality is fantastic ( cd quality ) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes !
as opposed to the nomad ii or any other flash based player , the songs load extremely fast about one or two seconds per song
i 'll be getting a second one for my router table !
i 've had to install and uninstall them four or five times so far , and i 've not to get either product working properly
the phone has such advantages as the excellent keypad and display , long rundown time and a good software suite
by no means do you have to be a tech junkie to be able to install it , just be able to put a cd in the computer and it tells you what to do
both of the problem dvd 's would repeatedly freeze during playback , while the counter on the player kept going
i 'm very pleased with my zx so here 's a quick review
i love this pail !
it is more than 90 days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do
the subscription files are still a little slower to transfer , but it 's only by about 10 or so
excellent sound i mean the player has juice
the diaper champ is so simple that my toddler loves to put his own diapers in the diaper champ and flip over the handle
this setup using the cd was about as easy as learning how to open a refrigerator door for the first time
along the way we compared it to my wife 's t720i and the 6600 was superior in terms of battery life , connectivity bars and features
the optical and digital zooms combine to give an effective 4x zoom
the good small size durable seeming metal case easy to use visually distinctive good picture quality fast usb connection mostly intuitive operation really cool photostitch software that knits pictures together to give wide panoramas
i 've had it for a week now , do n 't regret the purchase one bit , and i never leave home without it
respectable , solid , but not awe inspiring
after getting used to the m12 all the rest seemed lacking
well , i have an ipod mini and i really like it , but all in all , i like the zen micro more
i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet
although i disabled norton antispam , it is still there
sorts music by artist , album , genre , etc it 's easy to wade through 5 gigs of tunes to find what you 're looking for
1 small
since i use it in a table , i don 't use the plunge feature , but if i ever need it i 've got it
the sound is incredible very clean , very wide dynamic range of bass , midas and highs , and can be very loud if i turn it up full blast
the headphone jack seems to be a major problem
first thing i noticed was that the creative wasn 't well made
some adjustments in the settings could help make it better
i just received my 40gb zen xtra yesterday and i 'm extremely pleased with it
very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price
first of all , i bought this dvd as a christmas present for my girlfriend and i am somewhat disappointed
lens visible in optical viewfinder
the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software ( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth )
if you are looking for a small camera to throw in your pocket , take great pics and video , get the sd500
drops and strong signals even from the backyard
the 4300 comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win98 without problem , battery charger , usb and video cable
i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers , and they both delivered great results
battery life is ok
advanced photo bugs will find more creative control than imaginable
operating its many features is easy and often obvious i 'm no annie levitt 's , but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store
after several years of torture in the hands of at t customer service i am delighted to drop them , and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family phones from at t to t mobile !
what this product really needs is better documentation for how to set up the router for different operating systems !
the phone book is very user friendly and the speakerphone is excellent
it is much easier to fill and unload than the diaper genie , plus , why buy refills when you can use trash bags from the dollar store ?
7 have a good chunk of my small mp3 to listen through the speaker phone
i 'm probably the only person that dislikes the itunes software
you can 't do that with a sony t610 ( which i traded for a 6600 )
not plug play relies on id3 no fm or recording
2 the camera is so small that when you attach some lenses i have the 19mm wide angle wc e 68 , the optical viewfinder is partially obscured
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough
i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down now buy it !
the instant setup button in the front of the router messes up the network it is better to configure the router manually
they were easy to setup with plenty of power to hog through anything i have encountered
this is definitely one of those products , especially as the company is leaning more towards making a profit
the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand
actually using the nomad jukebox is easy and uncomplicated
i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like
limitations not a lot of original accessories like the ipod
the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit
i also use the phone as my modem via bluetooth to my apple power book !
unlike other reviewers , i like the tool because it is easy to operate outside of the router table
configuring it for a home network was almost impossible
looks snazzy smaller than a pack of smokes easily transported ac charger included as well as a hard shell that comes with a clip and a stand adapter usb cable !
i highly recommend this !
connect the player to your computer ( via usb ) , open up mediasource , and you can listen to your stored mp3s as they stream directly from the xtra !
i had to sit on the phone with customer support for 2 hours and they did not help at all
great picture quality in automatic mode , quality is great
5 ) video recorder is of no use and one can not record something useful in 10 seconds and it takes a while to send the same through the free picture and video messaging offered by service provider
it has lots of little cute features , my favorite being the games and the pim ( personal information manager i e organizer ) , and the radio !
even the pdf manual that comes with it is pretty vague for someone not familiar with mac settings , etc
1 your hitachi might come to you with a stiff spring mechanism
i bought this little guy a few weeks back , and i have to say that i never had so much fun with a new toy as this
the camera is adequate and if i want high res photos i 'll use my digital camera instead
not only is it more affordable , but its a better player for windows , which is what i have
the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent , and finally the price , 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent
lots of flaws , but exceptional sound quality , hd size , and price make it a good buy
i assumed they had exceptional service , but their reception in my area ( laos angele 's ) is horrendous
there are really easy directions for setup and fiddling around with the picture , zoom etc
door broke after a month
( ) like most soho routers , it has nearly non existant logging
i love my new nomad , its great !
the controls are on the side instead of on the front , which i like , because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing !
it all sounds great too
to use the creative zen player with a subscription service , you need to go to creative 's web site , and download new software for your pc
it plays basically every media i 've tested so far , even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could n 't be played on my old 200 sharp player !
the design , as mentioned above , is sleek , cool and trendy ( and i think trendy good , but it 's always hard to tell these days )
many people have written about the software being its one downfall , personally i have n 't had a single problem with the software , i 'm running windows me
user 's guide doesn 't cover a lot of important info that is covered on their website
the songs do n 't play one after another like on a cd
the flywheel you use for most of the navigation was n 't in tightly and it was uneven as far as the amount of pressure to make it engage
the controls and the menus are clearly displayed and easily fathomed
you 'll love it !
i love that you can create custom playlists , and organize music in so many different ways
however since this router is backward compatible , that doesn 't pose a problem at all
linksys quality and tech support have been outstanding
so far it all works fine with either cable or wireless connections
the buttons on the phone are small , even for my small fingertips , but you get used to them rather quickly
it comes with a good case that fits it snugly
crappy headphones
as an engineer , i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale
creative software stinks
other than that , i love this camera
i wash ours out with lysol each time i empty it , and that helps , but when its hot out well , just be prepared
the cons , at times the diaper wipes get stuck in the disposal area making it hard to turn the handle back and forth
the extra spare battery is just a neat bonus
the zen was an impressive purchase and i would highly recommend it to anyone using napster
less than a cheap cordless drill or a laminate trimmer
this is really a no brain er
apart from speed , the signal is consistent and works without interruptions , etc
the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless
photos are pretty darned good !
the ipod is not overpriced compared to the market
has the click wheel and the ability to scan through thousands of songs and organizes them great
i also wanted to switch to broad com hardware ( which the linksys uses ) because my wifi menisci card in my dell laptop with lucien silicon in it used 70 of my 1 2ghz laptop 's cpu when using the wireless at full speed
the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image affecting settings in the camera
the headphones have great sound and durability and mine came with some extras when i bought it ( a stand , a belt hook , charger ) that i know doesn 't come with every one
also , not liking the gel case
the 6600 ( t mobile ) is the true 'world phone ' in that it has the mhz to operate around the globe , including new zealand and australia ( 900 ) whereas the 6620 ( available from singular ) replaces it w 800mhz ( some refer to as 850 )
one of the best cell phones i have ever used to date
will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles ( if you have live albums or greatest hits albums , this will cause you inordinate frustration )
battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k reeves
the 2600 had false silver plate instead of play display
i give it 4 stars only because the installation process or rather problems that may surface during the installation process can be frustrating to the average computer user
i ended up buying one for upstairs and one for downstairs because it works so well and because i change him so often downstairs
color screen is good
difficult navigation i wo n 't necessarily say difficult , but i do n 't enjoy the scroll wheel to navigate
the remote is okay , but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons
only then did i learn the truth this phone does not work with palm pdas !
my case doesnt close maybe mine was just faulty , but the case isnt that great
even on the low sensitive level , a slight touch can skip or pause the track
i 've printed several photos and the prints look as good as the screen views
at 8 ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod
this is a great diaper pail
i just went on a quick photo shoot in nyc 's central park today , and what a bunch of beautiful photos i took , if i do say so myself ( and i do ! )
only problem is that is a bit heavy
very small
video output stopped working
i sent creative customer service 3 emails in which they did not help me one bit and don 't seem to even want to help
its size makes holding it steady for long a bit of a challenge ( not enough camera body to grip with more than your finger tips )
the storage capacity is great
at double speed ( 2x forward speed ) , it still plays mp3s with sound they are pitch corrected and smooth , but twice as fast !
it is a bit cumbersome , and i can 't get to the songs i want as quickly
they said they would refund all the money , but a month later , they tell me now the back up disc is not refundable as its cost is purely handling and shipping 15 to handle and ship a cd ? and they have been indignant and combative on the phone and in emails
it is far better than just a trash can or the diaper genie and it 's fairly inexpensive as baby products go !
it is embarassing getting phone calls from family members telling you that the dvd player you gave them less that 3 months ago is no longer working
i have no problem using the player itself and i feel it is a very good player
if you are already using a previous version of nortron security and uni stalled it to install the new version , you will still have all kind of problems in installing the new version on your system !
its fast forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i 've had
apex 's website is down and they wo n 't answer their phone
at first i had a problem with some smell , then i realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in then there is no smell at all !
the router has plenty of power for any type of bit or wood i need to cut , and the speed control knob is easy to get to
the software that came with it was tough to load
i researched and researched between getting the canon s20 or the canon s100 , and of course i got the latter !
i was using a motorola t720i with verizon and i had alot of dropped calls and i had troubles syncing data
the bass is deep and the treble is clear
the camera is a dream to operate in auto mode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes
and for those that are int rested the recharger works anywhere in the world ( and is quite small )
i 'm convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed , and will not hold up to normal use
this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature , to find out more just log on to canon 's website
great sound ! i was very impressed , i encode at 192 kbps and the audio quality is great , especially with the better headphones
it is crystal clear
especially the lcd is big and the camera quality is among the very best around
2 ) the delay from the time you fully depress the shutter to the time the picture is taken is too long and may yield some fuzzy shots
we don 't have to worry about running out of refills with this diaper pail !
ripping transferring tunes is basic , and pretty fast ( even on a 1 1 usb )
i recommend t mobile and the nokia 6600 without reservation
utility its got a huge list of features including an fm recorder a calender and contacts list
4 ) buttons are quite small and is really a pain exp if one is fond of text messaging
but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in auto mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it !
some dvd 's i rented would not play
everything , so far , has worked flawlessly
not counting the time i spent editing the songs ( i suppose i should 've done it anyway on my pc ) the transfer was pretty painless
first of all , i 've never been big on earbuds they 're just not that comfortable
that 's it for now , what are you doing still reading this , click the add to cart button already !
it 's very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout , and it has a great feature set
m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) it does n 't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music creative or any other company all my 12 5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags hooray !
the included earphones are pretty good my advice ?
this is an excellent router for the price
it may not top the ipod mini , but it 's definitely an alternative if you also want the extra features and good sound quality
i also like the fact that you can edit your mp3 titles , etc
if you are using linux , and you want to use gprs to connect to the net , i suggest this phone along with a belkin usb bluetooth adapter
size bigger than the ipod
1 the diaper champ doesn 't require special refills that are expensive and hard to find !
the size is small ( just a little bit bigger than an i pod )
so easy to set up , had some problems with my archos
the antivirus feature is phenomenal , and is regularly updated
it has never worked
the pc side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated
one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu
naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing ( i recommend www no madness net ) , and price wise zens are unbeatable
i am bored with the silver look
anti spam is good
i thought this camera was awful and i did tons of research on cnet and other sites
the inside pics , can be a bit challenging , but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like , that are not focused perfectly , or need lighting adjustments , make this camera very simple and effective
even though you could get a cheap router these days , i 'm happy i spent a little extra for the linksys
you can use the player to store your computer data files ( good feature to have )
about the product the zen micro is a sleek , stylish device that caters not just to hip youngsters but to people of all walks of life who like to listen on the go without having to worry frequently about battery life , size , or the awkward factor
deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with 3rd party earphones ( 20 ) and software ( 25 )
as a loyal customer of norton symantec products , i purchased internet security 2004 as a software firewall and could not be any more dissatisfied with the product ( and hence the one star rating )
in any case , navigation by artist album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders
the player itself has all sorts of problems
so sit back , relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can 't do half the things this one can , and for a fraction of the price !
i 've been using nis 2004 for about 2 months and it works well
price and capacity
unfortunately , it does not give you the option of installing ( or installing ) them individually
a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging how could one eat rice one grain at a time ) )
as it stands now , the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the player up for travel , or if you load up all your songs beforehand
even though i have the parental controls off it constantly starts updating them then freezes my computer
can 't get easier than that !
i think sound quality should be the first and foremost feature , and the zen is leaps and bounds better in sound quality , with no need to upgrade the earphones
another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen
could be better to be a perfect camera ( and some competitors do some of this better ) purple fringing , details in high light area , noise over iso100 , red eyes , ( few ) processing artefact 's , ( few ) loss of some details especially of the hairs of peoples in low light , automatic autofocus , whizzing while video playback , better video compression ( smaller viedo files ) , more manual controls , longer lasting battery , indicator for battery , better protection of the lcd , less weight
( we wrap them nice and tight ) we use our regular kitchen trash bags cheap !
the fm tuner , the 5g of storage , and the removable disk are all great features
on the plus side it 's packed with features , including bluetooth that works fine it 's really a tiny computer that is also a phone and that 's the negative
the other pail i used started to smell after 2 weeks of use
but when we went to use it again , there was sound but no picture
even leaving it on the default setting ( without the eax enhancements ) produces crystal clear playback
as often mentioned , the scroll tab is average , however , not difficult to use or horrible
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does n 't seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as ( i believe ) the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked
the touchpad is virtually unusable sometimes you have to press like mad to make a selection and other times the slightest brush causes something to be selected that you don 't want
if you want to purchase a real case or container or clip on carrier for you zen micro , expect to purchase it separately and to dish out big time
the controls are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this
as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away !
i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust
what a disappointment !
you 'll do that because the keys are tightly packed in and your fingers will likely press two keys at once
unlike other reviewers , i have found the support to be responsive , almost no wait time on the phone , and relatively knowledgeable
the achilles heel of this router is its inability to stream music , or copy large files over the local network
my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags that takes a while to do if your mp3 files do n 't have them
our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality , great features , long battery life , and an unbeatable price
screen was good , easy to read
the only drawbacks i 've encountered are 1 indoor shots from a distance 8ft lack contrast and color , but i 've found this to be a problem with all cameras with built in flashes that i 've used even on a nikon slr
the router works fine for both wired and wireless
i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision
this phone has a nice blend of features without going overboard
) button sensitivity even reduced to the lowest sensitivity setting , the buttons are far two sensitive , really takes some getting use to , and even then , it is still too sensitive
digital zoom is clear too say you used all 3x optical zoom , try to do digital zoom then just try not to shake the camera at all and you 'll still get a clear good quality picture
i 'd recommend this is you want to wireless network your laptop , but if you want to wirelessly network a couple desktops together you might want to wait until linksys improves their desktop software hardware
when the screen stops working , you 're out of luck !
quite simply , the firmware and or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time
second , the setup cd actually worked perfectly
only one complaint about the speakerphone , you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone , not while it is ringing
you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does n 't make that big of a disturbance
it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera
this router does everything that it is supposed to do , so i dont really know how to talk that bad about it
the only downside to this is that it can get pretty stinky long before the pail is full
the software has n 't been a hassle for me at all
well , i got my second player , and right out of the box it wasn 't working right and once again , after consulting customer se !
best in class sound
we keep the diaper champ in our daughter 's nursery and her room definitely does not smell like dirty diapers
too difficult to change genre album track information for large number of tracks
the light auto correction is awesome
even with that , i highly recommend this router outstanding performer
i 've tried the free versions of zone alarm and the free version of skate and they both have a nice and easy installation and work great !
it is the most bang for the buck out there
the problems i had installing norton extended way beyond what symantec should reasonably expect the public to deal with
transfering i could not get my songs to completely transfer via usb 1 1 or 2 0
second , the menu system and controls are poorly designed
downloads are a snap and quick
great colors , pictures and white balance
10 great price for all the features
also included in the games section is the great music trivia option which tests your skill at being able to quickly place your own songs
otherwise , it is difficult to figure out and awkward
this phone has the best battery , it lasts longer then my old 3210
it 's really well made and has survived sliding across floors and pavement without a scratch
now it will not load any disk or just says that there is no disk
i 'm not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over 250 dollars for
the price is incredible with the bonus pack and hitachi 's 25 incentive ( you need the code go to tool seeker com and it tells you )
looks and durability i realize many people are fond of the minimalist white interface
the menu is easy to use and understand
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones
i think the os and controls are very well thought out and although i 'll admit i was a bit intimidated during my first few hours with the micro , the interface and controls became second nature after the first day or so
so , i 've had it for a month , and the headphone jack went out
i upgraded from an older 801 11b router to the linksys wrt54g for its improved security , and of course , speed
while i had the phone , the positive features were good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece
you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll
the height adjustment works well not perfect
while the perfect odor free diaper pail has yet to be invented , the diaper champ is a good as it gets
i did notice if you turn the phone on and off the os takes a bit to load up and initially the menus are slower but once the phone has been on and booted up the menus are reasonably quicker
pros 1 speed 2 signal strength 3 advanced configuration options
they really are awfully small
update the finish is more mirror than silver and i like it !
this phone has many other features , ir , just to name one , the features above i view as the most beneficial
i was more excited about this player upon opening than i was about the nomad
after 57 pictures total the lcd went black except for the icons showing the settings
the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport
some movies it played yesterday , it wo n 't play today
we just recently had to buy another roll of bags so 6 00 for a year of bags can 't beat that ! !
longer battery life , greater accessibility to online music services , and pc compatibility are the sensibilities
maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing
it is a very amazing product
i would highly recommend that you do this if you want to learn something , but if you are not interested in learning this stuff and just want a working wireless router , just get the wrt54g
just point and shoot and the photos were great
it played only one out of three dvd 's without problems , the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches
the sound is great , and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise
i have n 't had time to really push this player to the limit , but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory , as should be expected from creative labs
you can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly
the fm radio is cool
people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either the case is sturdy and offers very good protection
but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive !
songs transfer lightning fast , and the two batteries that came in my box give me 24 hours of listen time
the pictures are absolutely amazing the camera captures the minutest of details
the only problem i find with it is that the plunge mechanism will eventually stick due to wood dust
i received this little jewel as a gift and i can honestly say absolutely love it
nikon 4300 , i feel , is the best camera out there for the features and price
the scroll bar again takes some getting used to
but canon never fails to amaze
there is no way the battery supplied lasts 14 hours !
i 've had this thing for less than a month , treated it quite well , never dropped it , and the headphone jack is all screwed up
3 ) the case hides the display you have to open it to see what you are doing
i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites
i installed , activated and registered nis 2004 without issue
but , it seems to work so well now , that i do n 't anticipate any problems with it
n6600 supports midi , wav , arm , mp3 etc
the menu options are uncreative , as you can 't see a full screen of menu items to pick from you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for ( yes , this is minor , but not when you 're trying to keep your eye on the road ! )
the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have
i love this camera !
the interface is simple to use
i will say that the os that the phone runs does have a few issues
it sounds decent , but i would estimate you get maybe 80 of the quality that you would from a true line out jack
but i wanted to do some raised panel work and needed more power and variable speed to run the large diameter bits
the only problem i have with the buttons is that the power button and print share button don 't have a nice click
i didnt have any installation problems and the touch pad is fine , even if it is sort of inaccurate
also , the touchpad seems to be waterproof to some degree
zennx 's replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod
at the end of the day , what i wanted was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go , and the zen xtra 's combination of price , capacity and features easily meets those criteria
outstanding signal reception
the extra gb is just a bonus
i bought mine in december of 2003 , and have had no real problems with it
update january 27th 2004 the second one crapped out only after a week dont buy this product !
the edge guide has a nice micro adjust feature that works well
the zen micro fm receiver is ok , not great
the instruction manuals and documentation are excellent so that the learning curve will be much less steep
it also costs a lot less than the ipod
overall this tool is very well worth the price and i have no regrets about my purchase
in my table the m12v has been a real champ
however , i am very disappointed with this product and with symantec
screen review could be better
picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from 35mm
it is a great router for a table and with the depth adjustment knob it is easy to adjust depth precisely
norton has been on a downhill slid recently with their products , but with this one , they have fallen off the cliff
i love the slim design the weight would only be an issue if it were bulky
you have to purchase that separately for some outrageous cost
anted to rate the router higher than 1 star , due to its security , easy of use , etc
ease of use design the ipod is a very easy to use mp3 player , and if you can 't figure this out , you shouldn 't even own one
photo stitch ( merge pictures to create a panoramic one even my old one can do this and it 's really cool to have it now still )
i received this item for christmas and it has met and exceeded all my standards
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the 40 for the 2 year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it , since creative will only warrant it for 90 days which in itself is totally ridiculous !
i love the quality of the pictures
being a very economical person , i appreciate the fact that any plastic bag can be used with this system i never did like the prospect of buying special diaper genie refills
as with most headphones that come with any type of music player , i recommend throwing these into the nearest river , unless you like having hard , round pieces of plastic in your ears
it has enough power to hog out all the material in one pass , but i usually take multiple to prevent blowout and a smoother finish
the box included a little polyester , pull string bag , ( yes , you read right a bag , something a boy would carry ten marbles in ) and tries to pass it off as the case
the documentation is much better than the documentation that came with the 11b router i needed a lot of help from linksys technical assistance to set that one up
this is also the case with nis 2004
the bottom line is phone is cool one only for the moment , as its the latest phone in the market and has all the new features , but this will soon be displaced by upcoming newer phones
it is great sounding , even with the supplied earbuds
but with a low price , comes lower quality
the blue light also makes this player one of the most fashionable in the market also
for the price , i am considering purchasing a spare just to have as a backup
the most recent is that it will stop responding to the on off button
and with usb 2 0 , transferring music to your player is incredibly easy
it films 10 second video , for crying out loud
i called apex 's support number numerous times but it just kept ringing
when you consider expandability ( downloads via computer ) , the numerous features , two transmission programs and multiple storage devices , dependability this is a phone that isn 't easy to out grow
flash as with all built in flashes in small cameras , you get over illuminated main subjects with depth being lost
to my amazement , even that process was error prone
these include mp3 , wave , wma , wma pro , and wma loss less it is very user friendly simply by right clicking the file ( s ) to be converted
combine this with the excellent price we got in the gold box , and i 'm really happy
it is some protection for the unit , but for use ability , forget it
all in all , it 's a good router if you don 't have the cash for a speed booster one
i 've played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too
i read in consumer reports that apex is a reliable brand , but with my experience and reading the other reviews , i think i will be doing a little more homework before considering another apex product
seems to work great
( batteries last longer too ! )
it 's not my first choice in cameras ,
the phones are awesome
i will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture
the screen is large , defined , and easy to read , and the silver unit is naturally cool
i compared it to other cd players ( two models of panasonic , rio samsung ) and they were no way even near zen micro
with the champ all you had to do was drop the dirty diaper into the opening and flip the lid
my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems
only downside is when taking pictures in low light conditions without the flash
i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the rigor of a business traveler
the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me
i also had no problems installing or running the camera software on my pc
best in class
on my main computer the software did not work right
the fact that has an open source firmware makes it a great option in my opinion
multiple users on one machine never seemed to behave like you 'd expect
so far i have no complaints with this player
battery life keeps improving on the ipod , and a new ipod will give you up to twelve hours of play time , per charge
it beats apple on the storage space , it beats apple on the removable battery ( and batter life ) , and i personally like its interface more than the ipod scroll wheel
4 ) one nice thing about nokias is that they have a ton of ring tone and game choices
yes , you may get a whiff of a smell when you flip the handle , but then it is gone
its ability to serve as a back up for my music collection is a huge plus
good color and very little needed to correct photos on paint shop pro
hitachi 's m12v is a big beast of a router
for the price i don 't think you can beat it
i upgraded from nis 2003 , and the change in performance has not been noticeable
this camera is bulletproof
first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint
4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! )
the day finally arrived when i was sure i 'd leave sprint
honestly , i love this player
i hope it 's because it 's new and they are not out yet , but being without a remote is hard
the player hangs up on file transfer every once in a while , prompting a reset
overall an excellent phone
the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me , however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate
3 the picture editing software it came with is adequate , but not very robust
1 ) player is not plug and play need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it
cuts are easy and smooth
opening the champ to empty out the bag is a little tricky i pinched my thumb a few times before i got the hang of it
the earbuds are great headphones as good as my ak studio 240 , well not as good but darn close
however , setting up using the quick start instructions was a breeze
within a year , there are problems with my menu dial knob
in addition , it only seems to work if you 're about five feet away from the player , although that may have been just the batteries that came with it
for more than a year , and it is totally reliable
i bought 2 of this model for christmas presents and neither one of them work !
this is one of the best purchases we made
transfer through windows explorer windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad
the speed control is recessed too far in the housing and required a tool ( screwdriver or dowel rod ) to effect any speed change
the volume
luckily , with 3 rebates this product will cost me nothing ! it is indeed worth nothing
after a week i tried to load some more songs and delete a few but the auto load didn 't do anything but turn on my player
with bluetooth off the phone last almost twice as long
the storage capacity is great for me
the player has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any
the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away
i highly recommend it if you are looking for a phone with great camera quality and or lots of features you would find in a pda
also , multiple picture feature is very , very fast
well just one con its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it , it will be a breeze
speaker phone quality is good , and poping in a 512mb mmc card , it rocks !
built in microphone is great for recording short voice notes
there are a lot of things i like about it
this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price , you can 't go wrong
this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has
it has a handsfree loudspeaker , conference and transfer !
first of all the player 's sound quality is superior to the ipod
1 ) the included lens cap is very loose on the camera
overall , this player is awesome and i definately recommend it
i am now staring at an array of stuff including zen micro player , stereo earbud headphones , a rechargeable lithium ion battery , an ac dc power adapter , a usb 2 0 cable , a belt clip , a stand , a stylish cloth pouch , an installation cd , a quick start guide , and creative mediasource software
you can use it as a storage hard drive
while , there are flaws with the machine , the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability
this new click wheel ipod allows you to navigate through the menus and song via a touch wheel for scrolling and click able buttons for selection
excellent sound quality
i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on line support site and their telephone line , but they wo n 't answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy
the ipod is overly sensitive to just about everything and gets scratched easily
so far the software for the pc works easily
unfortunately , this digital moment capturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted
it plays just about any format ( check before you buy if it plays yours )
i loaded a lot of photos into it and they display very clearly for such a small screen and , very importantly , the transition from one photo to the next is instantaneous
buttons do seem a little sticky tho and the hands free kits ' connector might be a problem
this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you 'll use all the time
the scroll button is sort of annoying to push a nice button would be nicer but eh , not a big deal
the s100 's image quality rates in the middle of its class , but it can still be a reasonable choice for students , families , or small businesses looking for an ultra portable camera that weighs less than half a pound with media and battery pack
i 'm an advocate of nokia , but this phone and the following models ( 7610 ) , are seemingly a desperate trial at squeezing as much under engineered and experimental technologies in one sloppy phone
the functionality on this camera is mind blowing
very simple and painless
bottom line if you value excellent sound quality and the ability to use music subscription services , and are willing to deal with the possibility ( not the certainty ) of setup gremlins , by all means get the zen micro
again , this doesn 't affect regular mp3 files just subscription drm encoded files , like those from napster to go or yahoo music unlimited
the wizard is particularly sinister
the main advantage of this system over its predecessor is the ability to open a wider pipeline between clients
another point of note the battery life is incredible !
battery life is good , although i recommend two rechargeable , or a alkaline backup , for those emergency pics you have to have
the thought of not having to buy refills and just using regular bags is awesome !
to make matters work , there is no manual override to overcome this problem
all the camera 's functionality is only available ( or selectable ) when the screen is functional
i like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets
everything else about the ipod is great , the click wheel is very easy to use and so is the software that comes with it
but after 10 days , the sound worked , but the video quit working
so far i haven 't had so much complaints except that i still haven 't mastered how to scandisk when using internet security
the phone can use any midi audio file as a ringtone
it 's so small
the af feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 3 4 of the screen and the image still looked normal
i enthusiastically recommend this camera
unfortunately it turns out to be the disposable type
it also does n 't have voice activated dialing big minus ! !
and it is extremely well priced for what you 're getting
it constantly drops the internet connection and simple things like walls in our house block the link so everything is very slow
it has several play options , one of the best is an option to shuffle , based on all or a certain playlist
the manual is excellent
i highly recommend this camera to anybody looking for a compact camera that can take good quality pictures
i 've had it for about 2 weeks and it 's the best player i 've seen , and used , ever
sharper pictures
the best 4 megapixel 4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use
a decent camera phone for taking quick pictures , movies , and having general all around fun with
the door would not close
comments overall this is still a great value , but is kind of overrated in the sense that there are beater deals on the market
this really is a great little phone its got nice features , a beatiful screen , great ergonomics , and its tiny !
i saw a few complaints on the load time of menus and i feel people are over exaggerating the menu load time
on the fly play list creation , address book , removable storage drive capabilities , sound recorder , the list goes on people , this thing is literally so chalked full of goodies , it was like halloween all over again
i couldn 't get the install wizard to work
it 's faster than wmp
i 've had nothing but good luck with t mobile
it has a 3x optical zoom , which is average for these cameras
sure they say if it 's their fault you won 't get charged , but they are the ones who get to decide whether it 's their fault
this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player
setup is totally breeze and linksys 's web site is pretty easy to navigate
the memory ( 40 gb ) is staggering
it was immediately noticeable that nis slows down my computer ( pent4 , 256 ram )
it also has a voice recorder and fm radio that you can only get on an ipod if you but an adapter seperately
the included software removes any red eye easily
this model appears to be especially good
i thought i 'd have to buy a set of headphones to use with it , but the included earbuds work quite well
the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot
the other day when i was listening to a song , it locked up and will not do anything now
i then tried to set up the router through linksys 's browser interface , but as the only instructions available tell you to use the installation cd , i had little luck i did manage to connect briefly , but the connection kept dropping , and with no idea of how to resolve that issue , i gave up
it really is the perfect travel camera , plus it offers the convenience of digital photography
bottom line , this camera will give you a lot of bang for the buck !
the wood can be pushed thru fast or slow with little bog
i guess the two antennae help with that besides making it look cooler
the hole to put the diaper in needs to be larger as i am now using medium diapers ( i have a 3 month old ) and they 're on the brink of being too large to fit no matter how compact i make then and how un soiled they are
i 'm sure you can read the specs above to see everything it does , but for me the best thing is that i can easily check my email , movie times , news , or any website with this phone
the pictures are fabulous and their is a ( short ) learning curve to it there are tons of features i have n 't even gotten to
i thought the software was decent enough it was n 't complicated to learn at all
although the sound quality is good , it takes more than good sound on a portable mp 3 player to result in a good product
the sound quality is excellent , accessing the music is easy , and the controls are generally well thought out
i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category
its nice look is also a plus
the lcd is larger than the previous model , the nx , and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx 's green backlight did
you can do so much more with the pc suite , i e free ringtones from midi files , free graphics from any picture on your computer , and if you know how to program jame you can even make your own apps games
4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome
battery life is awesome if you upgrade the firmware requires a windows pc or make sure to always plug the ac adapter into the player before plugging into the outlet awesome sound quality i mean it is creative right ?
p s the only snag i encountered while initially configuring the device was trying to hook up the micro to a front usb port the bus for the front port on my motherboard did not have enough power after connecting it to the rear ports , it works perfectly
thankfully , creative has come through with a product that puts the ipod back in its place
being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable
2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera ( semi serious amateur photographer )
i did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it was n 't a big problem
decently sized screen one of the larger ones on the market at 2
am i ever glad that i decided on this camera !
however , configuration of my system and actual setup of the router for wireless use took me more than 3 hours , and briefly made me reconsider my choice to for ego the airport and its notoriously easy setup
no matter the format
my only complaint ( really more of an observation ) is that the outside finish of the ipod is rather delicate , so i am going to get a case for mine so it doesn 't get all scratched up
the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots
the hands free speakerphone is quite powerful ( like the motorola phone , i used to own )
i find it pretty easy to use and unlike the remote interface for the audigy 2 nx ( on the pc )
i have it for a week now , and this camera has exceeded my expectations
i couldn 't believe what i had been missing
the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it
the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car , very audible even with freeway noise
the picture is clear , bright and sharp and the sound is good
i was unable achieve a sound quality on par with my simple portable cd player with bass boost
sound quality is wonderful , i really like the smart volume sound normalization
it gives great pictures , the controls are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing
in fact , people who have been present while i changed my almost 3 month old son 's diaper have been amazed at how the very 'potent ' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once i dispose of the diaper in the diaper champ
this phone has a very cool and useful feature the speakerphone
uploading the images to my windows based pc is very fast and simple
handset quality is great , as is the speakerphone quality and the headset audio quality
easy enough to navigate through , although i 'd prefer a sturdier button besides the thumb wheel scroll push button
compared to other leading dd mp3 players , the value per gb is the tops
the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close , a very annoying thing after ah wile
the handles make it very comfortable to use and i experience little vibration
my biggest complaint is the battery life or lack there of
i 've always liked symantec products , except for this version 2004
took hundreds of pictures and they were great
it can not be the computer or the owner , since i purchased mcgee anti virus 8 and it installs and works fine with no problems
the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies
it was a very quick setup and installation , in fact the disc that it comes with pretty much makes sure you cant mess it up
the smooth operation variable speed and a set of good masada bits will provide just the right combination for great predictable results
this is ridiculous
capacity is not a problem here
it would spin , read , spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc
it 's rechargable and supposedly easy to replace though i haven 't had to do it yet of course
the creative zen micro , at first glance , is a dream come true for all mp3 and music lovers
the disadvantages of this camera is it has been having some trouble with its autofocus on a few occasional pictures , especially quick candid shots where you start up and shot as quick as you can
it 's not a listed feature but , the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video
there is a clock , and date , which can get helpful
the sound quality is superb , much better than that of an ipod , in my opinion
way less expensive than the ipod
and the firewall came with a wizard which made it effortless to configure it to my lan
i would have given this phone 5 stars if it wasn 't for the fact that i would rather use my 3330 to do all the most common things you do with a phone
1 ) great audio quality overall
sound quality on this is amazing , as with all creative products
i 'm giving this player cautious recommendation
i love the storage in this thing
i have tried other pails , but none have compared positively to the champ
you can 't change the battery , so i don 't know what i 'm going to do in a year or so
this player is an ideal purchase
as a windows user , i had to install the software including drivers and itunes on my desktop , and this is the only area where i encountered a nuisance
it 's also so easy to use and holds a great deal of diapers
what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical
i 'm not overly fond of green but when i used this hitachi m12v it turns out that now i 'm very fond of it
i had tried to uninstall norton internet security a few weeks ago , and it wouldn 't let me do that either
my fingers are kind of stubby so it took a while to learn how to hit a key without hitting the adjacent ones
styling ergonomics the keys are small , which generally doesn 't bother me if they are spaced because i can employ a little 'braille , ' but the keys run into each other , so careful attn must be paid when dialing
so , you might inquire , why don 't they make it a first priority to carefully , simply explain how download music from your music library to their device ? ? ? this seems academic to me
i am really impressed by this dvd player
the ear buds that come with it look cheap , but the sound quality is amazing
this unit comes with the usb firewire cable as a standard item now
i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it
while i have not had the privilege , as many call it , of owning an ipod , based on the experience of friends who have had some misfortune with their ipod ( and subsequently purchased the zen touch or zen micro ) , i can pretty much rest assured that my decision to purchase the zen micro was one of the more informed ones
enjoy
this phone is one of the milestones in the history of the cellular phones
buy this if you like mental challenges or trying how to pick locks
lots of sound options , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options
the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built in flash
the picture is perfect , although i 'm not watching on an hdtv
i , as many others , have waited for many years for the convergence of price , features , size and ease of use to hit that happy center point
i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use
the manual is easy to understand , and it is mostly idiot proof
the customer support is pathetic
newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box
if you haven 't noticed , they designed it so that you can also take vertical pictures when you do the self timer
i also own a retail store and this little guy easily plugs into my aux slot in the store 's sound system
by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot , i was able to produce excellent stop action photos contrary to what other reviewers experienced
the earbud headphones are really nice
in conclusion , i gave the ipod a 4 5 because anything this expensive should would work just about flawlessly
i noticed that the micro adjustment knob and collet are well made and work well too
this is an excellent player , especially for the price , with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod
i 'm easily enlarging pictures to 8 1 2 x 11 with no vi sable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet ( super fine )
i have only used it with the 1 4 collet and a 1 2 round over bit , but i love how it starts up with little torque and runs very quietly
even better , with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio
it is nokia and thus easy to access the menu options
the lens retracts and has its own metal cover so you don 't need to fuss with a lens cap
the only downside i see is that it does n 't look like you can manage playlists from the nomad , it has to be done from the computer
camera is a paper weight
i got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon
battery life is about 1 4 of that advertised , no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players ( on or off line ) , occasional software lockups , replacement battery is expensive
the moveable lcd screen is great
i 've attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs , using a multitude of connection methods , and i still can 't get a video signal from the machine
the movies last about 5 seconds
the player usually plays dvd 's , but has occasional problems such as 1 ) not recognizing a dvd 2 ) stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it 3 ) not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd
it 's running great for all the dvds i have and rented
while going for a cellphone , i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones
very long lasting battery life
the arm band is fantastic and it doesn 't budge even at the gym
hold button suprisingly not all mp3s have this this allows you to have all the buttons unusable , so that you don 't accidently hit something in your pocket
i love having the option to manually control the f stop , shutter speed and even focus
it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs , it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies
other than that pictures taken in the dark are not as nice as i 'd like them ,
the two times optical zoom operates smoothly and quietly , and lo and behold , a two piece shutter like cap automatically slides closed over the lens when you turn the camera off
as one other reviewer pointed out , it does occasionally take a little effort to push down the plunger to get the diapers in the pail , even though upon inspection the bag doesn 't really look full
if your looking for a great sounding mini player , you can 't go wrong with the zen micro
i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse
my daughter is only 4 months old and we do notice an odor
but it wouldn 't let me turn the av protection back on and it wouldn 't stop with the alerts
i have a hard time using other phones with smaller screens ! ! !
so far i have used all of the above mentioned features , and find them well designed , and easy to understand
when you learn how to change some settings , you can make the quality even better
in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side mounted volume control
i have owned this camera for a short time and would n 't give it up for anything
the sound quality with jazz and pop music is equally superior
if you don 't mind all the buttons being touch sensitive , i 'd re comment buying it to try out , and also buy an extra 2 year warranty for it ( there are some offered here , for about 15 dollars i think )
you can take pictures seconds after you turn the camera on literally !
the interface works great
the first one we installed did n 't work , and our kids were devastated to say the least
i rarely get drawn in by mass commercialism , but something about the ipod made me say , in the words of lou and andy , i want that one ! i was willing to shell out
the unit itself its well structured , with just the buttons you need and none you do n 't
this is my second creative labs mp3 player , and it is definitely a fine product
bright , visible screen
the remote is a little hard to understand
our norton internet av 2004 was terrible right from the get go , so i 'd think that if steelworks is ok now , it should remain ok
i purchased the elph s100 mainly because i thought it was cool
i dont especially like how music files are unstructured basically they are just dumped into one folder with no organization , like you might have in windows explorer folders and sub folders
we 've purchased 3 universal remotes so far all claiming to work apex dvd players and none worked
it had issues right off the bat , with freezing up , staying in 'shutting down ' mode , and just not functioning very well in general
i love this phone
because it can help a so so photographer take spectacular photos !
what this plug in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware
i have had the phone for 1 week , the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i 75 , far superior to at 38 t 's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route
start up , log off , log on everything became very slow
i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots
i did like the heft of the machine
for example , i tried playing my new pirates of the caribbean extra features dvd , but this dvd player can not read it
like most of their solutions ( which first blame other applications for errors ) , the tech persons line was that this was probably a microsoft error it was not
basically the 6600 is a bundle of over hyped features you don 't and won 't need ( if you do get yourself a pda or pocket pc ) , none of them work as they should , and the basic phone functions and ergonomics are less than average
2 it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow
i find this to be a great feature
but , if you 're looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player , i love it !
the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources , you can 't do this on the ipod ( except for a cumbersome work around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player )
so far ( 3 weeks ) , we 've had no problems with the diaper champ at all
norton internet security 2004 is one of the more buggy implementations
it has all the features one would need in a cellphone
the photo quality is amazing and i know i 'm going to have fun with all the features
the player 's mechanics are also flawed
after getting one for christmas from amazon , i 'm now a believer the digital elph is truly the world 's smallest digital camera that shoots great pictures
even with the waterproof housing it is small
and , other else , the camera is still vga
i can use it as a modem for my computer , connect with clients and friends , the possibilities are endless
for those of us that like to tinker , i think creative offers some advantages
fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy the met 60 ct 4
i treat the battery well and it has lasted
4 ) the camera gets really hot when you are busy snapping away
this camera is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it !
i never had a single problem
this is the first phone i know of that has the large bright screen , infrared , bluetooth , usb connector and a speakerphone
received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector
p s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error ?
even with newborn diapers it filled way too fast
second might be a problem i might have with my pc but not too sure , when the player is connected on the usb and i start playing on it and also using the windows explorer , it sometimes pauses by itself and tries to synchronize with the pc during play , which is a bit irritating
regardless to this fact , i believe the champ is the best way to go
the first one would n 't work from the start
we hardly ever have to charge them , get great reception ( live in chicago ) , and the customization and applications are awesome
the interface software itself , which should be user friendly , was anything but easy to use
i have to say i 'm also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg , mp3 and mpeg files stored on cd rs dvds
it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime
the main issue now is that this new zen micro seems to be the best on the market at least temporarily
i 've also had the nomad zen lock up several times
excellent phone , the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures
it is extremely light and disappears in your pocket
it 's worth it
if you are looking for an upgrade , this is definitely the phone for you
bookmarks for example , are an excellent feature but not on this player
in short , the nokia 6600 is an evolution but not a revolution
that said , i am disappointed in the plunging mechanism
the bottom line for me is that i am very happy with this product
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus
i originally gave this camera 5 stars when i had windows 98 it was wonderful but i got a new computer last november with xp the usb software is soho not compatible with xp
7 ) chic look and good build the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate
this is the third apex product i 've bought and they continue to impress for the price
the darn thing works as promised and it 's amazingly cheap too
but i was ready to upgrade and when i discovered that canon was going to come out with an even smaller digital camera with a higher resolution , i had to have the s100
on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd
it works great
they made the other end of the camera flat so you can put the camera upright on a flat surface if you don 't like to take the usual horizontal pictures using the self timer
zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player
what i really like about its quite , it can handle my workload and it was so cheap that i can throw it away and buy another one without blinking
it works with a minimum of fuss
right now , the creative software transfers subscription music files very slowly
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was n 't as easy as i would have liked
i have not been disappointed with my purchase
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n 't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight )
whether you are a novice or an expert , its ease of use and functionality goes together
also , the display is hinged and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage
as far as user interface is concerned , the best and easiest to use seems to be the one that comes with the player , 'creative mediasource organizer '
smooth plunging ! ( it did stick a bit so i sprayed it w lubricant
retraction said mine had silver plate it does have display
the photostitch software is very cool if you want to do any 360 degree panorama shots
just a little overview , powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr like camera , its 4 megapixel and ( almost ) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance
negative impossibly tiny and difficult to operate , barely visible , power button
the good 1 ) large lcd screen , colorful display , good resolution
all of this said as it 's on it 's way back to amazon , the one song it did include provided far better sound than the ipod
sure , it slows it down a little , but that 's expected
can 't say whether i rec 'd an updated model but it will not read dvd rw 's or vcd 's for me
either way , can 't go wrong with this price
software downloads on the site crashed my pc
even at the normal setting , a 8x10 print ! shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a digital
it has n't gone below the second notch ( i charge mine whenever i 'm at home and not using it ) , so the battery life seems fine ( so far )
one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software
all my questions or problems have been quickly and satisfactorily resolved
i also like the lock feature , so it makes the touch pad inactive
i have to move pictures off of it every day so i have room for more pictures the next , and i don 't have enough money to buy the 256 meg card that i 've had my eye on for a while
white earbuds ( i replaced those with some shire headphones , big difference ) , a case , a stand , a clip ( which doesn 't really work ) , and a nice little zen micro bag
i 've tried leaving questions on their site never to have them answered
getting the router setup in a vanilla configuration that works for 99 of users was very easy , and i was able to do this no problem
the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens
plus , the fact that it used regular trash bags is great
itunes this is a love hate relationship program usually people with mac like this program than people with a pc , but depending on your computer expertise , this could be a difficult program to use , and it is required for an ipod
it 's light weight enough to take with you everywhere , but powerful enough to get outstanding pix
i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful
the battery life is less than stellar , but it charges w the quickness
overall , i am very pleased with it
the zen micro is smaller than it looks in pictures , and feels very solid
i bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it , or have already bought it it 's size
anyway , this player is a great deal and i really love it
i can 't smell anything ( and believe me , this is quite something with my baby )
once you set it up , it 's great
if i had to do it over , i wouldn 't buy anything else
this year , it seems that i choose my timing perfectly , having discovered the awesome device that is the zen micro
its steel backing picks up fingerprints and scratches easily , not great from a cosmetic standpoint
cons no am fm radio tuner something a large number of compete tors are doing
this isn 't uncommon in cameras , though , just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries , you should be fine
i just bought one and returned it as defective for good reason
but this is not documented in the zen manual neither the hard copy nor the cd version
well , within 45 days the video output quit working ( both rca optic )
looks and shape i have a black one and the first time i charged it and switched it on jeez the blue light looked so cool
the nomad zen could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case
mine generally requires a charge every 48 hours or so and i don 't really talk on it that much
it 's as though nokia has segregated 90 of the screen for fancy features rarely used and leave just 10 for the day to day use
the customer service dept did not list a toll free number and it was a real hassle to get through on their regular line
i 've had this beauty for nearly 2 months now and i truely love it
) one outstanding positive feature is the battery it holds a charge for a long time , longer than most other similar products and the user can replace it easily or take another along as a backup
8 ) creative mediasource , although not as sleek looking as windows media player , is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cb service ( gracenotes )
while light , it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets
however , this product performed well below my expectation
the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable !
the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i 'd have liked them to be
the sound is quite good , in terms of volume
really happy with this little camera
it is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder , but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree ear piece which is included
i would put the hitachi up with the best !
have a great and easy to use bundled software
with the ipod , you can also store documents and contact files ( from programs such as microsoft outlook ) when it 's connected to your pc as an external hard drive
the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone else 's is too
the blue backlight is pretty cool
other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better
and , with the ipods ' full volume up , all you have to do is adjust your receivers ' volume and your set , since the ipod itself acts as a strong amp lifer of its ' own
goes 3 days after a charge
i love this camera
the transmission speed is also quite good , with pages loading very quickly
at first glance , i thought this phone was a little too big for me , maybe a little too complicated
having done all this , i was quite pleased to see that all corners i needed were decently covered by the signal
i would recommend this camera unequivocally !
also , diapers tend to stay in the middle , causing the pail to get backed up
also , their t zones , although cheap ( 4 99 mo ) never works
i give this product five stars for its usability , performance , expandability , and definitely looks !
the new hardware version does not run linux at all and most likely will not since the memory has been cut in half
the micro seemed like an ipod for less
on average , indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm
i find the apex ad 2600 to be a great buy
a lot of fragments were left in the registry , and it the norton system folders
i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit
there are so many functions in this little , yet powerful camera !
the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them
this has happened with several different dvd 's and occasionally if we keep trying something , it will work when it did not work one time before
i really regret signing up with t mobile , but i 'm stuck with them for the next 6 months of the contract
i like this router a whole lot better the linksys 11b router it replaced the signal strength seems ot be much strainers , seldom falling below the very good range ( and most often excellent within 25 50 feet of the router
it is very easy to change bits without removing the router from the table and the shaft lock works great
other than this , i am very pleased with the router and would buy it again
it doesn 't bog down under load
in fact , each of my creative mp3 players had software problem in the first place
setup in xp was instant and intuitive
the software is great
it just tells you to start disconnecting and attaching cables without any input as to whether your current setup includes a pre existing router ( mine does ) , without any clarity as to whether you should be running the wizard on a hard wired pc or a wireless equipped pc
there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone , it is a great phone , mine worked without any problems right out of the box
you actually can talk to a real person for support in under an hour ! )
i 've had no problems w this phone
the pictures are razor sharp , even in macro
my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software
it takes great pictures
it took several days of attempts before things finally worked again and i have n 't a clue why
i highly recommend this phone to anyone
but like i stated , its better then a trash can , but i 'm not sure if its better then the diaper genie
1 a cell phone is to make calls , in other words , quality of reception and mic speaker are the most important , the 6600 has a relatively low volume speaker , you 'd have to press it hard against your ear to hear anything the other person is saying , unless the surroundings were completely quiet
it was a good player when it worked and i loved the design
also if you do manage to get it installed , any problems with liveupdate or with system works will also affect the functionality and or the process of updating internet security
you can record your voice and turn it into a ringtone
recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m 4m pixel fine combos and many of the user friendly functions are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately
canon 's g3 does it consistently
noiseless , lightweight and oh yeah
the only free help you get is in renewing your subscription !
we have had this product for over a month and yesterday it stopped working
mine was so bad i had to to use a hammer to free it ( and this is why i 'm giving it 4 , not 5 stars )
4 ) usb 2 0 means fast data transfers ( 1 song sec ! )
all that said , i am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera
rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area , the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made
this is my first mp3 player and i am so impressed with what such a small device can do
the battery stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter
regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop
seriously ! i love it !
i sent it back , as i think that the speed control is either poorly designed or defective
the build quality feels solid , it does n 't shake or whine while playing discs , and the picture and sound is top notch ( both dots and dd5 1 sound good )
i enjoy getting use to the touch pad
at the very least , a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice
the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me
the battery life is not that of the casio 's but its good and your going to get better pictures in my opinion with the battery life you 've got
finally , compare the ipod to other players on a cost gb , and also consider ease of use
the zen micro is near perfect
the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone , saved me hours of re entering my numbers
1 the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod , and it weighs a little bit more
at 128 the songs sound very good
the flaw is inside the zen
speaker volume is loud and clear but it sacrifices the battery life
the appearance is okay ed ( at least not ugly )
putting the micro into your pocket could trigger just about anything ( unless the hold feature is improved it asks if you want to unholy for every button up press ) second , i 'm worried about the durability of the player
i 'm extremely glad i bought this camera
it locked during install and i had to reformat the drive and start from scratch ( greer ! )
anyway , my wife got this for me for my birthday and i love the thing
camera quality isn 't bad for the low resolution
they 're pretty comfortable , stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality
i think their antivirus software was one of , if not the best , on the
the scroll button seems ok , i have no problems with it
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod , but i have gotten use to them , and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price
when i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd r media disc 's that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could n 't get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with
works perfectly with my netgear wireless paramecia
it would work fine for a while then as the motor warmed up it would die
pros excellent sound , even with the headphones that come out of the box , but it absolutely rocked with my bose quiet comfort 2 set
i 've been using the g3 for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it 's advertised
another irrigation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long , it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on
5 the price is right
just follow the instructions carefully , it 's all based on a cd that has everything you need to get you up and running in no time
that 's when it went from oder less , to odorous !
the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class
other plusses changeable battery , loads of presets for environments , decent construction , still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod
some features that the 'zen micro ' has that sold me on my purchase include a 5g hard drive actually an sd flash card drive very large and much more than actually needed , the ability to sync with microsoft outlook 's calendar , the long battery life of about 10 to 12 hours ( i can change the battery myself for about 40 to buy vs
it wouldn 't always work seamlessly with wmp and it often required me to restart the frozen micro by taking out the battery and restarting it
many of our disney movies do n 't play on this dvd player
and i can 't warn you enough to stay away from norton ! !
i 've had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision
the video recorders a bit odd , sometimes i get 9 secs on my recordings , sometimes i get 17
almost from the beginning , liveupdate would not function
good looks
forget about the sleek looks if it can 't play some of your real dvds
i took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended
but that is good for me because symantec soft wares are a bit hard to master for me who are not savvy on computers
this did manage to cut the number of pop ups during start up from 4 down to 2
really like it , easy to use , great images , very intuitive , fits in my jacket pocket
i could hardly use it without a recharge in 2 days !
the look feel i have the black one and the contrasting neon blue on the buttons add a very nice ambiance
yes , the 1 800 number probably redirected me to someone in india , but the guy was easy to understand , and he helped solve the problem
learning how to use it will not take very long
i love the touchpaper controls
the zen micro ( mine 's black ) has a lot going for it
the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use
outside of the t mobile service area the phone seamlessly jumped onto at t wireless and various other services where the t mobile service was unavailable
it 's easy to install the security on this product but linksys doesn 't do a good job of explaining why its important
a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories , as always
great phone , easy to use , excellent network , no regrets ! ! !
it could be a little bit bigger , but it 's easy to get used to
well linksys was one of the original big players in the router industry
i hope you have a magnifying glass , because the number displayed as well as most of the pop up options are tiny
putting in mp3 player , lots of games and application to download
eax equalizer accentuates diminished quality of mp3 files
my favorite features , although there are many , are the speaker phone , the radio and the infrared
i am seriously considering purchasing another wrench and just not using the sliding wrench which comes on the router
nice machines , but i consider their quality pretty low now
yes , i recommend it over the competition
a great camera , but here are some points which i don 't notice in most of the reviews here , which may be of concern especially to the more advanced amatuer
first , the cons a tad bulky not the most aesthetic looking player and does n 't support a folder structure
it 's easy for beginners to use , but has features that more serious photographers will love , so it 's an excellent camera to grow into
there is an alarm , i still havent used it yet , but it should be good
the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy , and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player , so it wo n 't take up space on your pc hard drive
in fact , i liked it so much after using it with my son who is now 2 years old , that i bought one for our new baby 's room
battery life is exceptional , lasting longer than the 8 10 hours that seem reasonable with most music players on the market
unfortunately , i sold it exactly a month later
the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine
i just replaced my old linksys router with this one , turned everything on in the right order , and it was up and running with no problems
5 excelent software package
i simply love this feature
creative did an awesome job with the design
it has many great features and very few bad ones
i was an early purchaser of the wrt54g , and had a few problems with stability and speed finally , the march 03 firmware update has resulted in an excellent product !
i tried calling the support number for a week , several times a day , and always got a busy signal
the setup was a breeze , i had some reservations about a wireless network ( see my review for linksys wet11 ) but this item was on sale as well as the wet11 so i just had to splurge
it 's easy and really works , with some incredible range
ks almost without fail , no matter what your taste in music is from relaxation music to hard rock , to hip hop , to korean and japanese , to afro cuban and salsa , jazz , blues , country and pop , this feature performs well
very annoying
i was fortunate to get the packaging that still included all the accessories ( desk stand hard case , belt clip , wall charger , etc )
it 's too bad , though , that !
the high resolution screen is easy to read and has a backlight
it takes a while to learn how to use it right , and at this point i am able to make about 70 of my calls using it
the digital zoom takes as good of pictures , as the optical zoom does !
four megapixels is great
then sorting the files is easy as pie
i can connect to my computer via bluetooth to transfer images , calender events , contacts and anything else
the support has been less than impressive , considering the cost
this is the fourth version of systemworks and the second version of internet security that i have used and it has always been a favorite
we lysol the champ every time we change the bag out and have not had any problems
if you call apple and tell them your ipod has been damaged , they charge you roughly 105 50 per minute and blame you for abusing your ipod
even though i never ventured into the cloth land , i was very impressed by how well this works at keeping diapers and their accompanying odor in the pail and out of our life !
overall , a good buy for the price
not only is it the perfect size ( not too small , not too large ) , it also has all the features a high tech phone user would want
after reading reviews of lcd problems , cracked , black blobs etc , i figured that it was probably a very limited problem
you can set the optical zoom before shooting and than while shooting video adjust a digital zoom in and out however due to the cameras light weight camera shake is a problem to contend with
on several different occasions it has displayed no disc with a disc inside
this is probably one of the few dvd players at 40 that can play almost everything you throw at it
yin to point out they have experience , and so the reliability of the connection you get is among the best
i love it ! !
for me , it is as important that the tool be comfortable to use as it is that it produce a high quality result
it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar
excellent picture quality on par with my pioneer , panasonic , and jv players
no way to contact their customer service
getting the program to install properly has been a living hell experience
it is not a perfect product but it does have a lot going for it
if you have an older version of internet security installed , you may also need to remove it as well before proceeding with systemworks install
we use the cheap 1 99 13 gallon vanilla scented bags from the grocery store but you can use any bag you have laying around
third , creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer
the dvd player is fine
i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since
6 the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge it does not charge by usb cable this is not tragic , but usb recharging would be a convenient ( additional ) choice
t mobile is trying very hard , and again they do have pretty good csr 's
it has a nice color screen
download it fast to your computer
freebies you get a cradle with detachable stand and belt clip , some thing very handy and useful
a call to customer support ( got to a live person within a couple of minutes ) helped me tweak a couple of the settings to streamline performance
they player 's interface itself is also very easy to use
other than the fact that one can 't delete a file directly from the ipod , the interface is excellent and mind numbingly simple to use
this phone is one of the best i 've ever used
i love that you don 't have to purchase expensive refills
we take this camera with us everywhere and are constantly amazed at the quality of the pictures that we get and the number of different ways the camera allows for pictures to be taken
) creative , inc the maker includes the barest of the bare minimum in the box , then through gross profiteering nickles and dimes you on every single accessory at extraordinarily inflated prices
i can not find a carrier for this phone i like , end up just tossing it in my purse
the fact that this model would play jpeg slide shows was a big plus for me as a visual artist , and i discovered by accident ( it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature ) that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cd r data disk without vcd formatting
which is really nice because you can get pretty much any piece of music in midi format for free on the net
4 play n gage games on it
it was easy to assemble , and the diapers fit perfectly into the little nook before they make their way into the pail portion
powerup is quick , and you can even set your favorite image to display for a second or so as it turns on
the new canon s300 is 33 larger and 26 heavier than the s100
its stable , so a curious toddler can 't easily tip it over
the touch pad would be a great thing if it worked well , and as i never had issues getting songs transferred to the player , i did have problems accessing them from the player
sometimes when you press buttons , the menu appears after a second or two
unlike some of the other people who received a lemon , my dvd player came in perfect working condition
they fix the problem and help you with whatever your i pod needs comes with two usb ports and a charger
most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy
oh , and another is the cool halo light that surrounds the touch pad , and light 's up when you touch the screen , and how the light glows when the zen is connected to the computer
this did not feel like quality construction and i was n 't sure how long it would last
with accessories , you can make the ipod into a digital recorder , broadcast it remotely through stereo speakers using wireless technology , and play it through your car speakers using either a cd adaptor or fm stereo broadcaster
but if i installed either one of these norton products , neither works after installation ?
it 's such a great camera ! i think it really was worth the investment )
the size is tiny , which i love
it would not hang up on calls
1 speakers at home , i rarely use it with the earbuds , though they are much better than the ones you normally get with other mp3 players
but the sound is very good ( and loud ) and works well on my portable speakers
the scroll bar is a bit of a pain
3 no voice recorder this has also become an important and popular feature that the ipod unfortunately doesn 't have
i think that for its price compared to the ipod the creative zen is pretty good
6 small but very clear tft screen
i have had several mp3 players over the past few years , and have to say that this by far is the best that i 've owned
although the supplied software can be annoying at times , on whole it is excellent
this unit was working fine for the 1st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared
i found using the supplied mediasource software very easy
this phone is very user friendly , easy to manipulate 38 very convenient to scroll in menu etc
it 's not as stylized as a sony or samsung
it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price
the instructions that come with it do n 't explain how to make things simple
ive had this phone for a year now and its the best phone i have owned
i read many reviews on norton i s 2004 from a variety of sources ( cnet , amazon , message boards ) and came to the conclusion that nis 04 was a terrible product and not worth the update
apex sucks !
it makes the nomad i purchase feel and look like junk
but it is smooth , it is powerful , it is affordable it has a proven track record
the way you have to shove your fingers under it and pull is just too tight
plus , if you order from amazon com , they will exchange it for you no problem
great camera , i have been using this for several months and got excellent results , simple friendly usage , in many scenes indoor , outdoor , snow , close up macro etc
i 'd be happy to talk to anyone about this camera
that 's a rare and valuable feature
the menu allows you to search for files by artist , genre , and album quite easily
this phone won me over , and a big seller was the size it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out
but it takes gorgeous pictures for a 2 1 mp camera
this one is full of features ( has bluetooth )
otherwise , it takes very good pictures shutter delay is n 't so bad either
i 've dropped it at least a dozen times to my recollection and it still works as good as ever
my last simpler nokia started right up and was immediately ready for use
i am quite happy having over 10 gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder
it looks very cool , and seems quite small to me and very light
weak points touch pad design could be better volume control controlled through the vertical strip , but purchasing a headphone with built in volume control will do the trick
my one issue with the mediasource software is that , despite pulling id3 tag data from the dds service , the ripping process fails to populate the year field
navigation system the zen xtra uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs
i would recommend this product to anyone
i get to chapter 34 and everything freezes !
i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds
the sd500 software install was seamless and the product documentation is very detailed
while transferring songs to the player , the interface has crashed a few times ( 4 5 times in a 4 5 hour period ) normally this would cause me major concern , but it appears that this bug is reproducible , which leads me to believe that creative will fix it with a patched version shortly ( or maybe it 's just my computer )
i really dislike holding a phone to my ear , and i 've found the free speak to be very comfortable and easy to use with this phone
this is a great phone i have this phone since feb 04 and i never have any problem at all
five gigabytes is plenty for my great albums
having spent considerable time with professional video gear , i find onscreen displays annoying
i have really enjoyed the camera on this phone
this is my first digital camera , and what a ' toy ' it is !
the ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic ?
the phone 's sound quality is great ( turn up the volume if its too quiet , people , this thing will get loud ) i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing
there is no comparison , the champ is easy and smell free , the genie was difficult to use one handed ( which is absolutly vital if you have a little one on a changing pad ) and there was a def finite odor emanating from the genie plus we found that the quick tie garbage bags where the ties are integrated into the bag work really well because there isn 't any added bulk around the sealing edge of the champ
ok , not quite everything but this camera is so compact that you will have it by your side when you need it
i found best results in most situation with manual center auto focus , manual mode , iso 100 ( shorter aperture time , so more often sharper images as with iso 50 ) , auto white balance ( auto white balance is better than of the other canon cameras i have and they already do very well )
one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low
after 3 months , it stopped playing higher number scenes on dvds
awesome for the newbie , though i personally like to fasten every bolt myself
no need for deodorizers
it will read and play all cd audio disc
however , symantec has taken a significant turn for the worse with this release
this camera is great , wonderfully small , and has attractive hi tech casing
it does not have an auto focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light
feature wise , its a lot better than the dlink and netgear routers out there
i tried disabling the various components provided with this product , paring it all the way back to anti virus only service and saw no improvement
unit took forever since the beginning to recognize and play discs
they also sound excellent compared to other earbuds including retail sets like panasonic 's and sennheisers
this linksys router does it for the right price
downside is the size of the phone , it is big for today 's standard
yes , the features are numerous
during install , nis would either freeze or not reboot properly when asked to do so
its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket
the diaper champ is the best !
the radio works excellent in my area , i 'm not sure everywhere else
when i finally got it working , it only worked properly for many a month
no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers
the diaper champ couldn 't be easier to use
as far as linksys goes , i have used several of their products and they seem to hold up well no problems
with the enormous numbers of diapers that you go through with a newborn , it was great how easy it was to dispose of the dirty ones
this is the first cell phone i 've owned , and overall , i am quite pleased with it
the only other problem was that security for the wireless connection
the games are decent , but u only get 2 to start off with
i purchased a jukebox , it got fried while being recharged , they asked for 20usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for reaping the damned thing
the focus is great , though , if you are not taking a macro shot
i find all of the controls well placed and not flimsy in the least
the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use
great camera
it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long , especially if you use the flash a lot
anyhow , this software is working fine and no problems since i installed it two weeks ago
extremely convenient
3 the nokia 6600 has a brilliant java interface
if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder , i highly recommend the camera
fm tuner microphone having a tuner in the player is a blessing
i 've got a buddy who 's trying to offload his almost new 300 systematic because he saw what this router can do
i love how small the thing is , and the blue glow i 've had it for two weeks with no electronic problems at all
as i mentioned in my first paragraph , it supports wpa security , which is far superior to wep
i 've had a lot of cameras , but this one is actually being used , and not stored in a desk it 's all ways in my shiest pocket
but this by far is the best phone out there right now !
i 'm amazed at the photo quality prints are indistinguishable from 35mm prints
my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money
i 've tried playing all of these discs and they all play great
who wants to pay 30 to discuss a defect in a product that just cost 95 ? ( i also bought the back up cd )
for those mac osx users out there , isync works fairly well
it doesn 't stink , ever ( like some have assumed since it doesn 't wrap each diaper into its own neat little cocoon )
if you experience problems with installation , you can visit symantec 's website , click the support tab , click the 'home or home office support ' and there is an automated support assistant that can scan the norton program files on your computer and it will tell you what is not working right and how to fix it
i also tend to like the sliding cover on switch found on many compact ps cameras since it 's much faster and easier to power on if you need to take that instant shot
the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited
the scroll wheel is better than the ipod 's as well , in that you do n 't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly just a small nudge of the finger and you 're there
and supply those stupid white headphones
my old sony ericsson t610 has this feature
after i had it a couple weeks , it got into a state where it could never find the device , no matter how often i rebooted my pc , reset the device , reloaded drivers , etc , etc creative 's online support was no help at all
and amazon com has it for such a great price how can you go wrong ?
was a bit wary because the software is windows only and i have an mac
i have over 2000 files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up
it is versatile and seems to be one of the best
not only is it functional and runs super smooth fast , but it is also eye candy
too bad they don 't mention anything about how the cd can 't be used with a mac
anyhow some demerits of this phone , the phone has a slow processor and the ear volume is lower than 6610 but then the 6610 has the best ear volume among most nokia variants
the cool thing about the ad 2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3 , wma cds , jpeg and kodak picture cds , dvd 's , dvd r 's
its easy to use and the sheer fun of being able to use an array of nikon accessories like the telephoto and wide angle lenses is the proverbial icing on the cake
other things that i miss are voice activated dialing and a standard 2 5 mm headset jack
just the home version of norton internet av has too many glitches and problems to even remotely bother with
when it 's working , it 's great but it is very temper mental
on the contrary , i 'm quite pleased with my upgrade
the number buttons are crammed into a 3x4cm area , the fonts are small , the interface is too convoluted and frustrating , it 's not that customizable as well
its ability to record radio is useful as well , but would have been more so if it could be preset
2 it can be operated with one hand leaving a hand on your baby on the changing table
avoid this product at all costs
the phone offers a 32 mb mmc card and i think that is certainly the most exciting feature
we constantly got windows virtual memory low error messages popping up foll wed by ridiculous slowdowns and or crashes
personally , i am very pleased with the diaper champ
i find it very stable and comfortable to use , it doesn 't jump around or make me feel like i need to use a lot of arm strength to keep it under control , and it has very good visibility to see your cut
second , it is incredibly easy to use
we can start by losing the shiny miracle material cover that you can literally scratch just by looking at it wrong , and thus eliminate the need for third party asking protective covers for an extra thirty bucks
i fell in love with this camera , it combines ease of use , with an immense amount of options and power
they didn 't know what the problem could be
i did n 't read a thing about how to operate it it was just intuitive
it is a great phone , if you are traveling all over the world , packed with wonderful features
i have been absolutely , completely satisfied with the product and its capabilities
1 month , no problems , great phone i 'm very pleased with my 6610 phone
i 'm not gonna go into the features cause if you 're reading this review , you 've probably already looked at them , but i must say the dj feature if very cool and the removable battery is also a bonus !
t610 supports only midi files
the software failed repeatedly
have used it frequently and have had no problems
you can create playlists , drag drop songs and playlists to your player , and rip directly from cd to your player
the included earbuds were uncomfortable
the hitachi collet simply was not ground accurately
for some this might be a problem , but for the price of a 30 gig ipod , you can get a 60gb nomad , the ipod simply pales in comparison
i tried e mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable
the photos in the address book are terribly scaled too they look as though they were built out of lego 's
i have the software working fine now and the mp3 player is fantastic
i connected my camera to the tv and played some video clips and for a digital camera to take such good quality clips , i give it 5 5 stars ) oh and btw , while you take video clips , you can zoom it too ! ( digital zoom only though ) but still ( my old one can 't do that you have to zoom it first if you want then take the video clip )
you 're going to need to buy new headphones , the stock ones suck
the camera was a marvel
overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned
only if we could get one camera in it
but this does work even if you turn off the lcd viewing great battery saver
imagine my shock and absolute instant disdain for any products made by apex
i have come across many other beginner cameras that i prefer over this camera , but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size
i just bought this player today and i already love it
but it you won 't regret it
very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera
the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds
this item is exceptional i like the ease of use and it held the odor in great
very easy to use for someone like me who 's just hopping on the digital camera bandwagon
iriver has a better fm receiver built in , but the drawback to iriver products is they are flimsy and poorly constructed
the instructions would benefit from some improvement and it would help if the rp ms of the speed settings were mentioned
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing
knocked 1 star off for the install wizard it wasted alot of time running it
now , the player 's ear phone jack is not working i have to send it away again
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits
where close to 12 hours but at least it is replaceable ( and they included a second one free )
in addition , i don 't believe that it is odorless
the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery , just like any other battery powered appliance
what i dont like nothing much except headphones , belt clip design
if i was pressed to find a negative aspect of the zen micro i would probably have to mention weak fm reception , but the building where i primarily use the micro seems to have a history of terrible radio reception anyway , so you can take that for what it 's worth
finally , i gave up and i purchased a router racier
being a past norton customer , i consider this to be a slap to my face
i actually took a friends word on it and went with this champ when registering and i am glad i did
made the camera totally inoperable
player works and looks great if you can get the dvd 's to play
i am an advanced computer user , so i can not even imagine how a new or novice user would ever get this terrible program to work !
however , this ultracompact allows the photographer to personalize his or her shooting preferences through a variety of preset and user definable modes
the heavy motor and continuously variable speed control let this router churn through everything i threw at it
they are extremely convent and you don 't have to buy them seperately has i tunes , which provides quality music at low prices
speakerphone
creative has excellent music software , a very responsive tech support group ( they are quick on firmware updates , and make them publicly available ) , and usually a good array of accessories
but those 2 come up every time
2 you still have to clean the thing ! !
there is an open source firmware on the net which has tons of extra features
i will never use all the whistles and bells this machine is capable of
1 it has all the features an amatuer photo enthusiast would want
my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took !
the new router came with an updated setup utility that makes getting the router installed a fairly straight forward process
however after purchasing a 20 gb ipod it 's clear to see the superiority
the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds
i didnt get ipod because i dont especially like itunes ( no music i want , but thats just me ) and the creative product was cheaper and i needed to be able to use wma files
the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat clean clear and well focused on over 95 of all photos taken by a beginner
if you on the other hand always use automatic settings ( and not manual ) you should be just fine , as the camera features some of the best automatic settings i have ever seen
the back of the player is nice too , with water ripples inside the clear white coating
very bad quality
as for the zen micro cons i read that every button is touch sensitive , and thats very annoying when all the main buttons are on the front
have had problems since the first day
this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio , but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's radio should work perfectly
the camera 's a work of art science that 's understood
yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway
the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality
the dynamic range seems not quite as good as the kodak dc260
it also has tons more features then previous creative products , and most of them are very useful such as the ability to customize the main menu to show the stuff you want , not the default items ( creative labs com for more on that )
first of all , the phone houses a great deal of memory for multiple videos , sound clips , photos , texts , etc
on top of being a workhorse and ultra reliable , it is just a plunge router that works really well
it has it all
the display and brightness on this phone is quite extraordinary
and , when you think about it , it 's insulting that norton requires its customers to jump through these hoops anyone who can provide proof of purchase , whether on the phone or online ( what if your computer is down ? ) , should have equal priority
it sure does !
the radio feature has superb sound quality
focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time , pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange
if you do n 't have tags , it 'll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they can not be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders
the colors are a joke , and i personally hate the stupid vertical touchpad
seems the program scan feature did not find the exe file for outlook !
after 4 attempted installs , i have finally given up
i have no complaints with this mp3 player
unfortunately , the touch pad issues non intuitive and poor instruction guide killed it
you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy
the firmware has bugs too , so download and install the latest firmware from linksys
9 ) wake up feature that allows you to set up the player to wake up and play selected music at a specified time
the battery life last es 12 hours , and charges quickly ( as mentioned above , the initial charge is a minimum of only two hours not too long at all ! ) once you 've downloaded your music , you can access the tracks by artist , genre , album , composer ( this comes in handy when the actual composer is different from the artist e g covers of songs ) , etc
each of the 4 lasted less than six months
the vibrate setting is loud !
besides the one problem , this machine is amazing !
if you are new to the market and looking to buy a symantec software product , save yourself some money and buy the 2003 version
what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd rs fill of files ( e , mp3s )
the controls are hard to manipulate , especially in the dark
for instance , i made several back ups of my dvd movies using dvd r ( w ) and r ( w ) and it plays the dvds
otherwise , get a smaller single speed router , which will be much easier to use freehand and is all you need for smaller diameter bits
this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities
sound exceptional , though i can 't really compare it to the ipod
finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best
one downside as of this writing , t mobile has n 't updated their t zone system to fully support the 6610
this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos , jpeg , wma , cmdr cadre dvd dvd , and of course plays dvd movies from uk i love the giff , progressive scan feature
the photo quality is amazing
from day one , we 've had hangups , crashes , glitches , continual reboots , long shutdowns due to cc app exe program running which is a norton program
the total price with delivery ( free shipping ) was 135 !
i must add to the dismay delight of readers this phone is simply the most groundbreaking phone mankind has ever held
the unit is easy to use and intuitive
it feels tiny in the hand without it
my biggest concern is that i have found nokia phones lower quality construction to lead to lower prices , but they also don 't last as long
at first i thought it is only a isolated incident , but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my alias dvds as well
it 's also easy to empty out
they are razor sharp , the color balance is perfect , and the focus is great
the voice recorders good , but you can 't record songs off the radio for ring tones
hate to wait between shots
here 's the brief synopsis the phone is tiny , cute , feels kind of plastic like ( as if it might break ) , but seems pretty sturdy
picture and video quality is ok
as for bluetooth , no problems at all
i 've had nokia 's for years , and while this one is packed with whiz bang features it is disappointing for its primary use a phone
and it does an excellent job of keeping the odor contained , which the diaper genie never did !
his is what i get for my 200 on this mp3 player ?
no skips , and it hasn 't faltered once ( despite your inevitable drop or two
11 ) minimal pause between songs less than that on other devices good achievement for a hard drive based player
after using it , i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket
the powershot g3 is a great camera
the face plate , which pops out for the battery , pops open by itself every 10 minutes or so
the zen serves as a back up device as well as a player
it 's so cute and behind the black panel it glows in a neon blue
i must admit its not the best looking phone ever but then it has this look of static and absolute conviction that looks like everything a phone should be
as a portable player , it should feel a bit more durable
the auto mode is good enough for most shots but the 4300 also boasts 12 versatile scene modes as well as a manual mode though i admit i have n 't played with it too much on manual
the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone , which you will enjoy
a ) feel cheap the plastic is feels like it would break very easily , and it definately wouldnt survive a drop
my only complaint and the reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the on camera controls aren 't as intuitive as they should be
this may be a really cool phone , but it 's not worth it with t mobile
they are sensitive and accurate ( perhaps too accurate , it senses through t shirt cloth , but the touchpad can be locked ) , but easy to clean , unlike buttons
the catch is that , while it plays movies just fine , it has refused to read second discs with the movie extras on them on the two occasions when i tried to do that
doesn 't have alot of good games on it
you just can 't go wrong with this one !
the fm radio 's reception isn 't spectacular , but it will pick up the most powerful stations in any given metro area
the opening could be a little wider , i suppose , but i haven 't really seen anything else that could be improved
diapers can get stuck when turned around if you don 't tightly wrap them first
the machine itself seems fine , but the software that came with it is awful
finally you will read a post somewhere that all codes are useless for the apex 2600
this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it
now he res the stuff you should know starting with the good things the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect , fast as hell in music transfer , controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button , great sound and ive heard many mp3 players , a ton of different equalizer type deals on here
removable and cheap battery a li battery usually works properly for 1 3 years
supporting an operating system , symbian os , you can download and run a lot of programs on this phone
other than that this thing is great
it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light
the headphone jack gave out after only a couple weeks of use , and the stock earbuds were replaced same day with some high end sony 's i 'd been having
i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high end player
the cons are n 't really a big deal to me except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files no folder structure and it 's based on the title of the songs many of my songs where separated into folders ( on the pc ) and a few had same titles so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n 't have any that might be the same as another
first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better
the gprs web access is slow !
software the software is crap
the scroll wheel is finicky it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have 50 75 success rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the device
this product is by far the best broadband router on the market , i bought this to replace one of those linksys instant wireless b routers , worked great for about a year
this is a nice feature ( i e it 's early in the morning and you rather listen to easy listening rather than heavy metal no problem
it is small overall , bigger than the ipod , but keep in mind that this is because different , less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx
for the first few weeks , this player was everything i expected it to be , an affordable multi format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised
new firmware update allows for automatic wireless network configuration
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does n 't show the complete file names of mp3s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting ( 2x , 3x , 4x , 1 2x , etc ) before getting back to normal size sorry if i 'm just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly
can recommend the hitachi in this ergonomic arena at the price quoted on amazon it is a bargain
for the person that uses the equipment every day , pay the extra and get a reliable safer unit
it was no problem for me to use their software
holds a lot of diapers a full week of toddler diapers !
also , when i dial an 800 number like an airline , it will not allow me to use number keys to navigate the prerecorded menu
compared to everything else in this category , this is most definately the best bang for the buck
i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology
4 ) no fm or voice recording these would have been nice extras
these issues aside , the ipod is kind of like the cell phone in that once you have one , you can 't be without one
possibly the biggest advantage this player has ( if price was n 't enough ) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery
the battery is nice
7 360 panoramic pictures are a very big deal
2 excellent picture quality and so simple to use ! ! !
always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped
night mode is clear as day
after using it for just a month , i could not play any dvd
a digic ii powered image processing system enables the sd500 to snap a limitless stream of 7 megapixel photos at a respectable clip , its start up time is tops in its class , and it delivers decent photos when compared to its competition
i bought this diaper pail when my son was just a few days old and i absolutely love it !
for purposes of clarity , here is my review from that product , edited to be appropriate for this product , since , for the most part , they share many of the same problems
i 'm in high school , and this camera is perfect for what i use it for , carrying it around in my pocket so i can take pictures whenever i want to , of my friends and of funny things that happen
one primary reason for getting a cell phone was so that i could use it as an internet connection for my laptop running linux , where soft modem drivers are hard to find , and don 't work very well
those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use
by far this seems to be the best value out there for the money if you are undecided , the creative zen micro seems to be the best choice
other than that it is all the same except the new updates
this thing plays everything i feed it
up , down , left , and right would have given me better control
one drop from a pocket or desktop , and it 'd be a goner
too costly and not efficient if you ask me !
having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific
1 ) great sound ( 98db signal to noise ratio beats ipod 's unspecified ratio ) and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head phones as well as external speakers
finally , after about a week 's use , the screen started to freeze on me
it is light enough to carry around all day without bother
( i knew this before hand , and it is not that bad ) there is no tiff format
i recommend it to both parents of infants and toddlers
it does have a lense cap , but it wo n 't let you take pics with it on which is real good
i use the same store brand tall kitchen trash bags i already use in the kitchen for it no special diaper trash bags necessary
at any rate , if you have been interested in digital photography but the price and confusion have held you back , consider the canon s100 digital elph
good sound plays very nicely , even though the stock headphones are kind of weak durable not the most durable because its mostly plastic , but very compact and sturdy
i 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this camera is making me happy
i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly
i have a canon a 70 , and now this sd500 , its amazing , how this little camera produces , such great pics , it even brings out ur pimples on the face
i got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon
i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disappointed !
after research of other creative hard drive players , i found that most of them aren 't very durable and tend to crash ( read most reviews on amazon com and see for yourself )
the leather case it comes with is pretty nice , similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly
it took me about an hour to set up a wireless environment in her townhouse and she hasn 't called me yet with any problems
the on off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera
the metal housing seems very rugged
a wise investment for the pocketbook for the nose ! ! !
this one has a color display , which i like a lot , being very visual
don 't use them , so i delete them for addle space
the camera res ponce is very quick
the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mils ( real estate broker software ) very well at all
get great themes and wallpapers for this phone and many many polyphonic rings
after nearly 800 pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures
after multiple tries , one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available
that is , you can not access the internet at all
have had the player since xmas 's and love it !
short warranty ( 3 months , so i got the extended warranty at best buy ) , occasional freeze up ( easily fixed by popping out battery ) , somewhat flimsy navigation wheel
it 's size also makes it ideal for travel
i had some issues when i had enabled wep encryption and then moved on to wpa
like other reviewers , installation was hell
other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the nomad 's operating system
my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price i found both
for my first i had a diaper genie which was not only costly with the refills but it was also very stinky
with the automatic settings , i really have n 't taken a bad picture yet
as any digital camera owner knows is that when you go to take a picture of a moving object to expect some blurring but with some preliminary testing we had simone move there hands back and forth under the lense and another person take the picture and suprisingly a crystal clear image appeared on the decently sized screen
i am extremely satisfied with this camera
i 've have many nokia 's and while this is the best for features , it 's the worst as a phone
i use it primarily in the provided protective case although i have dropped it about 3 feet from my desk ( by accident ) as well as have played it outdoors in 30 fahrenheit weather ( by design ) and it has continued to work fine
apex does n 't answer the phone
) worst feature possible , this alone makes it rate one star what 's up with no recharge cord ?
overall though , i 'm very happy with it and highly recommend it to folks looking for a mp3 player , even if it is to pretend your not a brain dead consumer giving into the marketing hype of the ipod )
the quality is superb
i find that if you remove the springs it is much easier to adjust and will not stick much
i have set up it 's pda features with avaunt com where you can download info from sites like weather , map quest maps directions into it , which is great
a little weighty ( 9 ounces no biggie ) , but otherwise fine
the movie clips taken will always have some ' noise ' in it you can 't avoid that
what is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off
i work on word , explorer , netscape , acrobat reader , photoshop at same time ( meaning using a lot of memory ) , but still dont see a problem with computer ( getting slow or crashing )
strong points design small , comfortable , curved , and stylish
this wonderfully small digital camera produces fantastically good pictures printed on any decent photo quality printer ( with photo quality paper )
the interface , while a bit confusing at first , is very easy to navigate after about 15 minutes
i still have over 19gb left , and already have over 200 cd 's on it
this camera has a major design flaw
the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road !
also , the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display , so even though the side controls are reachable , i have to open it up to see the display
problems with the sound quality were evident right away , but even i couldn 't imagine they 'd be that bad
overall , this product is awesome
no line out jack as i said , there is none
from the internet , woodworking books , local stores and personal opinions the hitachi m12v 3 1 4 hp router time and time again came up to be the router of choice or best for its price
i am absolutely in awe of this camera , canon put enormous quality into the g3
i hate apex but love amazon , and i tell everyone
it 's still one of the smallest 2mp digital cameras on the market , and absolutely one of the best built most stylish cameras ever
i purchased this phone knowing it was slightly old as compared to the newer models of nokia phones available
i 'm not sure why all the bad reviews , my computer isn 't especially slowed down and i have win '98
you do get 1 more gb than an ipod mini
overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view
if compact size is your highest priority in a 2 megapixel camera , the canon powershot s100 digital elph is a standout choice and aptly named for its diminutive design
but this camera is great !
its silver magnesium finish is stunning , and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen
no vibration !
it is a multifunction phone , reception quality is better than the 610
now that i have all my music on it there has n 't been any more problems
poor visibility on the keys
the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect
sound quality is amazing i was expecting worse , but its really good ( especially if your files have good sound quality )
i would however highly recommend the m12v router !
the only downside i have found with this phone is that it is a bit slow to react , meaning when i push the contacts button , it takes a while to load , this is true for almost all the menus and programs on the phone
warning ! the windows remove program feature does not do a good job of this , and neither does norton 's own removal program
if you are just looking for something to keep with you at all times , then this is a great camera choice
i even downloaded the product 's user manual useless
i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer
if i could , i 'd trade up on my creative muvo2 and snag a zen micro tomorrow
slow syncro flash , macro infinity mode , etc
other than that , the simian series 60 os is great and offers lots of proprietary software that will work on your phone if you 're willing to hunt for it
( it sure does look nice , though ! ) i recommend this to any music lover anywhere the quality of the audio is excellent , the controls and indicators rapidly become intuitive , and the storage capacity and battery life are huge !
the design and construction are excellent as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics
owner 's manual has substandard troubleshooting guide
games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games
great phone
8 perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets
i must have differing preferences than others here , as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony 's that i thought sounded good on other players
easy to use a lot of reviews has mentioned about this
this time , it started the installation process , then i left for work i think it will work i hope it will work
and the biggest plus is that you don 't have to buy any expensive refills
this thing is great , i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my counter top and also to listen to my old 8 track records
also , the player sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying
the battery , as others have said , also seems weaker than creative suggests
because of it 's hidden features ( no macro vision , non regional ) i keep this baby around to watch non american region dvd 's
the navigation takes so much time that it would eventually drive you crazy
if you hold down the scroll wheel too long ( which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through ) , it will get stuck rapidly going through the songs and wo n 't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it
this product has virtually all the same installation problems
i do give create to creative for their attractive design
the major reasons i didn 't give it a five are one , i didn 't think the fine adjustment worked well
i love this player
good image quality
however , the ipod does not come close to the number of extra features that the 'zen micro ' has to offer
the click wheel is incredibly convenient , however it can be a little overly touchy at times , which will make you frustrated with your own fingers
the only not so positive comment i have is about the depth adjustment , it is not easy to micro adjust accurately
the depth adjustment and bit changing is much easier on the m12v than it was on my old router
the clarity is unbelievable , which means you can cram almost the full 2 , 5 !
this product is too fragile for normal use
2 it is bulky and the small buttons on the sides are sloppy to use
anything this phone does , it does perfectly
i found it intuitive to use ( i did n 't read any documentation for it and was using it successfully within a few minutes )
when i got it home , i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were n 't there
i liked this one enough to buy another
i then realized a major design flaw
most of us just want to plug and play , not spend a year navigating a maze of complicated options like transfering everything on a hard drive to this stupid thing
this is a quality product , not to be confused with the cheap junk that hitachi gets manufactured in china
now the bad 1 ) as usual , battery power not sufficient for daily usu age
i really have no complaints over this unit
but , then again , the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office , when i was already out on the street
the installation software cd crashed repeatedly
sound quality was the same between the two , but the zen did have more sound adjustments with the normal eax features
i don 't know if we 'll run into trouble down the road with odors , but so far i have no complaints and i 'm very happy not to have to buy those refills
the cut outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls , especially the scroll wheel
comes with a installation cd which instructs you step by step to setting up the router
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote , which is worse than other , cheaper apex units
power for the tech savvy , ease of use for the less fortunate
it also holds a lot more diapers
the screen is quite big ( between all hand phone ) , but the just about 65000 color
and man i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title
it practically plays almost everything you give it
long live apple , long live macs , and long live the ipod !
and the slim form factor together with the mirror like front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey !
if you 're looking for a small , compact , super resolution digital camera , you can end your search with the nikon 4300 !
3 ) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer , like some players
overall , i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too
because this camera is beautiful
this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon never knew i could love a digital camera so much
the ! sound quality is great
i love the camera
even after reading some of the instructions , it 's still hard to figure out
i still need to read up on some of the security settings , etc to fully understand all that 's up there , but bottom line is that the installation was like night and day compared to the speed boost router
the panorama modes are wonderful
but i 've already emailed creative tech support about it , and gotten timely responses they will fix it for me if necessary
the sd500 has only been in my possession for a little over 3 months , and the lcd has been broken twice
and i must say this mp3 is very cool
scroll button the scroll wheel was a nice idea to keep less clutter , but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling
and we still love it !
there was no compromise this little camera does amazing things
there is not a word about satellite issues in either the user guide or the knowledge database at linksys com , and first tech support person i spoke with kept me on the phone for an hour , then gave me a web site address to consult that turned out to be the one i 'd already found during a search of my own
another problem is that the latest 2 0 firmware upgrade moves you into windows media player 10 which seems to be very , very slow for downloads charging 2
the dvd door would scratch the top of the disc every time it closed
i also love that you can flip the device with one hand
3 the remote capture and file viewer software bundled for photo capture is mind blowing
i can recommend this phone to anyone , anytime
as the 6600 uses 900mhz , it operates in more countries than the 6620
they last about 1 1 2 years until the problems start
the possibilities with auto , manual , and the very helpful scene mode , which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait , landscape , beach snow , sunset etc , are endless
it 's easier and much more convenient to use because it doesn 't have clumsy and confusing ( not to mention expensive ) refills
this version of internet security 2004 , is beyond hope
this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do n 't purchase it
i send my camera to nikon for servicing , took them a whole 6 weeks to diagnose the problem
creative labs customer support website is useless
however , it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my dix rips
the xtra improves upon the zen nx with a larger , now blue backlit screen , which is infinitely better
i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am very pleased
in a word , awesome is how i would describe this camera
one cabinet shop has been using one regularly in a router table for 11 years without a problem
also , the battery 's aren 't user replaceable
the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs to be charged while in the camera , but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery
initially , i was very impressed , after loading 180 songs it seemed to function very well but then it would lock up on me and a battery removal remedied this , i then downloaded the upgrades and everything seemed to be alright
since batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money saver since ipods , rivers , rca , dell , all have built in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement )
the soft start is nice
my experience with installation was quite good
2 ) the champ uses regular store bags
i prefer things that are simple
i already knew something was wrong , because much of the spam i 've seen in the past six months was from resellers of norton products
overall , it does its basic function very well , but we expect more from the mp3 players today and the zen micro does not rise to the occasion
the battery life seems good , takes very little time to charge , it uploads mp3s quickly and there is no delay between songs
again , the headphone jack on this thing is garbage
overall this is the best phone i have ever owned
the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry
while they all seem to have their own positives and negatives , i picked the zen micro over the ipod mini , because i am not an apple person , never has been i wanted something that is fully compatible with windows media player
the only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance
this dvd play is basically junk
i am very pleased with my purchase
the flaw is in the circuit board that the headphone jack is connected to
but if you use all bluetooth accessories , as i do , its really not an issue
finally , amazon 's free shipping is really getting good , it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me !
only slight negatives i 've had so far is that i haven 't been able to get it to accept any of my wav files yet
but be prepared to buy something else ( diaper genie ? ) which can trap the odor better
it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button
progressive scan player for a relatively low price ( although the better known manufacturers like toshiba , pioneer , and panasonic are now offering lower priced progressive scan players as well )
overall the ipod really is an almost flawless beast the capacity in the 20 gb is more than i think most people would ever need and , for the price , i highly recommend it
my first impression was positive
canon 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better
all in all suprisingly easy to use
the white led backlit lcd is very bright and crisp , even in sunlight , and relatively easy on the battery
i 'm giving it 1 star because as compared to other nokia phones , its a 1 , compared to other blunders by other companies ( such a samsung and motorola ) it might be good but if you 're getting a nokia , don 't get this one
it also has a stock tracking app built in ( also useless ) and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics ( currency , length , area , etc )
the one and most major thing that i was disappointed with , in this player , is the battery life
the sd500 rivals the canon g6 in image quality
the little bag it comes with is cheap and useless
sound quality ? phenomenal
and the battery life is bad !
it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ?
it is without even a slight doubt , my new favorite
and if you 're a mac user like me , they 've naturally made sure you have no viable alternative
i 've often struggled to get something to work the way i want it , and hate to have to carry the manual with me all the time !
it has an exterior design that combines form and function more elegantly than any point and shoot we 've ever tested
its a tough one this unless you wanna drive your car over it
i think it is a combination of the program size taking up resources and the open close scanning that it does with every program
es , the interface took a little getting used to , but once i did , it 's almost second nature now
the 30gb zen xtra rocks my socks , spills my beer , but does n 't wash my car
the only problem i had was a few components didn 't quite load correctly upon startup , but a reboot fixed the problem
its well made and user friendly
solid food poop is very stinky and this diaper pail doesn 't really contain the smell
gets stinky after a few months , the seal on the piston doesn 't seal anymore
if there was a zero star rating i would give it
touch ups , redeye , and so on are very easy to alter , and correct
the best part of the firewall is the visual backtracking
i 've been incredibly happy with this camera
the tiny ( postage stamp sized ) remote unit is wonderful not only does it trigger the shutter , it can also be used to zoom and review pictures
one it 's size it 's smaller than the ipod mini , and holds more music ( 5gb to the ipod mini 's 4gbs )
1 ) fragile ( i broke the 1st one within 10 days )
it fits comfortably in my hand and pocket
i can highly recommend this product because of its ease of use ( hardware and software ) , playback quality and value for the price
another 5 star performance
and it is very easy to clean
