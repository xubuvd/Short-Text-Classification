# Short-Text-Classification

In order to facilitate research of Chinese short text classification (STC), we public two large-scale corpus of Chinese short text as the benchmark. Its details as follows.

# 1. BSM, 
a large-scale bullet screen messages of size 100K collected from short-video websites, where the message is used for binary sentiment classification - Positive or Negative. We randomly divided in 70% for training, 15% for validation and 15% for testing.

# 2. VSQ, 
a collection of search queries of size 150K gathered from publicly accessible video websites. It involves classifying a query into fine-grained 26 labels, such as film, travel, music, fashion and sports. The split for training, validation and testing are same as BSM.
